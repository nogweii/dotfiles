#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: +list-fonts` command.

#: For the exact syntax to use for individual features, see the
#: HarfBuzz documentation <https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-
#: common.html#hb-feature-from-string>.
#: On Linux, font features are first read from the FontConfig database
#: and then this option is applied, so they can be configured in a
#: single, central place. To get the PostScript name for a font, use
#: `kitty +list-fonts --psnames`. The part in brackets is the PostScript name.

# modify_font

#: Modify font characteristics such as the position or thickness of
#: the underline and strikethrough. The modifications can have the
#: suffix px for pixels or % for percentage of original value. No
#: suffix means use pts. For example::

#:     modify_font underline_position -2
#:     modify_font underline_thickness 150%
#:     modify_font strikethrough_position 2px

#: Additionally, you can modify the size of the cell in which each
#: font glyph is rendered and the baseline at which the glyph is
#: placed in the cell. For example::

#:     modify_font cell_width 80%
#:     modify_font cell_height -2px
#:     modify_font baseline 3

# undercurl_style thin-sparse

#: The style with which undercurls are rendered. This option takes the
#: form (thin|thick)-(sparse|dense). Thin and thick control the
#: thickness of the undercurl. Sparse and dense control how often the
#: curl oscillates. With sparse the curl will peak once per character,
#: with dense twice.

#: Mouse actions {{{

#: Mouse buttons can be mapped to perform arbitrary actions. The
#: syntax is:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     mouse_map button-name event-type modes action

#: Where button-name is one of left, middle, right, b1 ... b8 with
#: added keyboard modifiers. For example: ctrl+shift+left refers to
#: holding the Ctrl+Shift keys while clicking with the left mouse
#: button. The value b1 ... b8 can be used to refer to up to eight
#: buttons on a mouse.

#: event-type is one of press, release, doublepress, triplepress,
#: click, doubleclick. modes indicates whether the action is performed
#: when the mouse is grabbed by the program running in the terminal,
#: or not. The values are grabbed or ungrabbed or a comma separated
#: combination of them. grabbed refers to when the program running in
#: the terminal has requested mouse events. Note that the click and
#: double click events have a delay of click_interval to disambiguate
#: from double and triple presses.

#: You can run kitty with the kitty --debug-input command line option
#: to see mouse events. See the builtin actions below to get a sense
#: of what is possible.

#: If you want to unmap a button, map it to nothing. For example, to
#: disable opening of URLs with a plain click::

#:     mouse_map left click ungrabbed

#: See all the mappable actions including mouse actions here
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

#: .. note::
#:     Once a selection is started, releasing the button that started it will
#:     automatically end it and no release event will be dispatched.

# clear_all_mouse_actions no

#: Remove all mouse action definitions up to this point. Useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default mouse actions.

#: Click the link under the mouse or move the cursor

# mouse_map left click ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

#: The visual bell duration (in seconds). Flash the screen when a bell
#: occurs for the specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

# visual_bell_color none

#: selection background color. If you feel that the visual bell is too
#: bright, you can set it to a darker color.

window_alert_on_bell yes
bell_on_tab "🔔 "

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the

# command_on_bell none

#: Program to run when a bell occurs. The environment variable
#: KITTY_CHILD_CMDLINE can be used to get the program running in the
#: window in which the bell occurred.

# bell_path none

#: Path to a sound file to play as the bell sound. If set to none, the

#: Window layout {{{

# Don't remember the window size, instead make new windows it 80x25 characters
remember_window_size  no
initial_window_width  80c
initial_window_height 25c

# enabled_layouts *

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the layouts <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts>.

# window_resize_step_cells 2
# window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing kitty windows in a layout with the shortcut
#: start_resizing_window. The cells value is used for horizontal
#: resizing, and the lines value is used for vertical resizing.

# window_border_width 0.5pt

#: The width of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. If not specified, the unit is assumed
#: to be pts. Note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.

# draw_minimal_borders yes

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: borders that separate the window from a neighbor are drawn. Note
#: that setting a non-zero window_margin_width overrides this and
#: causes all borders to be drawn.

# window_margin_width 0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

# single_window_margin_width -1

#: The window margin to use when only a single window is visible (in
#: pts). Negative values will cause the value of window_margin_width
#: to be used instead. A single value sets all four sides. Two values
#: set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top,
#: horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

# window_padding_width 0

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

# single_window_padding_width -1

#: The window padding to use when only a single window is visible (in
#: pts). Negative values will cause the value of window_padding_width
#: to be used instead. A single value sets all four sides. Two values
#: set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top,
#: horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

# placement_strategy center

#: When the window size is not an exact multiple of the cell size, the
#: cell area of the terminal window will have some extra padding on
#: the sides. You can control how that padding is distributed with
#: this option. Using a value of center means the cell area will be
#: placed centrally. A value of top-left means the padding will be
#: only at the bottom and right edges.

# active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.

# inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows.

# bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred.

# inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

# hide_window_decorations no

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only and titlebar-and-corners can be used
#: to only hide the titlebar and the rounded corners. Whether this
#: works and exactly what effect it has depends on the window
#: manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing this
#: option when reloading config are undefined. When using titlebar-
#: only, it is useful to also set window_margin_width and
#: placement_strategy to prevent the rounded corners from clipping
#: text. Or use titlebar-and-corners.

# window_logo_path none

#: Path to a logo image. Must be in PNG format. Relative paths are
#: interpreted relative to the kitty config directory. The logo is
#: displayed in a corner of every kitty window. The position is
#: controlled by window_logo_position. Individual windows can be
#: configured to have different logos either using the launch action
#: or the remote control <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-
#: control/> facility.

# window_logo_position bottom-right

#: Where to position the window logo in the window. The value can be
#: one of: top-left, top, top-right, left, center, right, bottom-left,
#: bottom, bottom-right.

# window_logo_alpha 0.5

#: The amount the logo should be faded into the background. With zero
#: being fully faded and one being fully opaque.

# resize_debounce_time 0.1 0.5

#: The time to wait (in seconds) before asking the program running in
#: kitty to resize and redraw the screen during a live resize of the
#: OS window, when no new resize events have been received, i.e. when
#: resizing is either paused or finished. On platforms such as macOS,
#: where the operating system sends events corresponding to the start
#: and end of a live resize, the second number is used for redraw-
#: after-pause since kitty can distinguish between a pause and end of
#: resizing. On such systems the first number is ignored and redraw is
#: immediate after end of resize. On other systems only the first
#: number is used so that kitty is "ready" quickly after the end of
#: resizing, while not also continuously redrawing, to save energy.

# resize_in_steps no

#: Resize the OS window in steps as large as the cells, instead of
#: with the usual pixel accuracy. Combined with initial_window_width
#: and initial_window_height in number of cells, this option can be
#: used to keep the margins as small as possible when resizing the OS
#: window. Note that this does not currently work on Wayland.

# visual_window_select_characters 1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

#: The list of characters for visual window selection. For example,
#: for selecting a window to focus on with focus_visible_window. The
#: value should be a series of unique numbers or alphabets, case
#: insensitive, from the set 0-9A-Z\-=[];',./\\`. Specify your
#: preference as a string of characters.

# confirm_os_window_close -1

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.

# tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts).

# tab_bar_margin_height 0.0 0.0

#: The margin above and below the tab bar (in pts). The first number
#: is the margin between the edge of the OS Window and the tab bar.
#: The second number is the margin between the tab bar and the

#:     Each tab's edges fade into the background color. (See also tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file.
#: separator
#:     Tabs are separated by a configurable separator. (See also

#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators.
#:     (See also tab_powerline_style)
#: custom
#:     A user-supplied Python function called draw_tab is loaded from the file

#:     this discussion <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/discussions/4447>
#:     for examples from kitty users.
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create
#:     a mapping for the select_tab action which presents you with a list of
#:     tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

# tab_bar_align left

#: The horizontal alignment of the tab bar, can be one of: left,
#: center, right.

# tab_bar_min_tabs 2

#: The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown.

# tab_switch_strategy previous

#: The algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab
#: is closed. The default of previous will switch to the last used
#: tab. A value of left will switch to the tab to the left of the
#: closed tab. A value of right will switch to the tab to the right of
#: the closed tab. A value of last will switch to the right-most tab.

# tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

# tab_separator " ┇"

#: The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

# tab_powerline_style angled

#: The powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when
#: using powerline as the tab_bar_style, can be one of: angled,
#: slanted, round.

# tab_activity_symbol none

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity. If you want to use
#: leading or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

# tab_title_max_length 0

#: The maximum number of cells that can be used to render the text in
#: a tab. A value of zero means that no limit is applied.

# tab_title_template "{fmt.fg.red}{bell_symbol}{activity_symbol}{fmt.fg.tab}{title}"

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title with optional symbols for bell and activity. If you wish to
#: include the tab-index as well, use something like: {index}:{title}.
#: Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for goto_tab N. If you prefer
#: to see the index as a superscript, use {sup.index}. All data
#: available is:

#: title
#:     The current tab title.
#: index
#:     The tab index usable with goto_tab N goto_tab shortcuts.
#: layout_name
#:     The current layout name.
#: num_windows
#:     The number of windows in the tab.
#: num_window_groups
#:     The number of window groups (a window group is a window and all of its overlay windows) in the tab.
#: tab.active_wd
#:     The working directory of the currently active window in the tab
#:     (expensive, requires syscall). Use active_oldest_wd to get
#:     the directory of the oldest foreground process rather than the newest.
#: tab.active_exe
#:     The name of the executable running in the foreground of the currently
#:     active window in the tab (expensive, requires syscall). Use
#:     active_oldest_exe for the oldest foreground process.
#: max_title_length
#:     The maximum title length available.

#: Note that formatting is done by Python's string formatting
#: machinery, so you can use, for instance, {layout_name[:2].upper()}
#: to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased.
#: If you want to style the text, you can use styling directives, for
#: example:
#: `{fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.tab}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}greenbg{fmt.bg.tab}`.
#: Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: `{fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}`.
#: Note that for backward compatibility, if {bell_symbol} or
#: {activity_symbol} are not present in the template, they are
#: prepended to it.

# active_tab_title_template none

#: Template to use for active tabs. If not specified falls back to
#: tab_title_template.

# active_tab_foreground   #000

#: }}}

#: Color scheme {{{

# foreground #dddddd
# background #000000

#: The foreground and background colors.

# background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
#: significant) performance hit. When using a low value for this
#: setting, it is desirable that you set the background color to a
#: color the matches the general color of the desktop background, for
#: best text rendering.  If you want to dynamically change
#: transparency of windows, set dynamic_background_opacity to yes
#: (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this option when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

# background_blur 0

#: Set to a positive value to enable background blur (blurring of the
#: visuals behind a transparent window) on platforms that support it.
#: Only takes effect when background_opacity is less than one. On
#: macOS, this will also control the blur radius (amount of blurring).
#: Setting it to too high a value will cause severe performance issues
#: and/or rendering artifacts. Usually, values up to 64 work well.
#: Note that this might cause performance issues, depending on how the
#: platform implements it, so use with care. Currently supported on
#: macOS and KDE under X11.

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped, centered or
#: cscaled. The scaled and cscaled values scale the image to the
#: window size, with cscaled preserving the image aspect ratio.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. This
#: option makes it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the
#: current background color for each window. This option applies only
#: if background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported
#: or background_image is set.

# background_tint_gaps 1.0

#: How much to tint the background image at the window gaps by the
#: background color, after applying background_tint. Since this is
#: multiplicative with background_tint, it can be used to lighten the
#: tint over the window gaps for a *separated* look.

# dim_opacity 0.4

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000
# selection_background #fffacd

#: The foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. Setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. Setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.

#: unconditionally. Requests received over the TTY are denied.
allow_remote_control socket-only
#: Environment variables are expanded and relative paths are resolved
#: with respect to the temporary directory. If {kitty_pid} is present,
#: then it is replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the
#: PID of the kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen.
# listen_on ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/kitty/socket

# env

#: Specify the environment variables to be set in all child processes.
#: Using the name with an equal sign (e.g. env VAR=) will set it to
#: the empty string. Specifying only the name (e.g. env VAR) will
#: remove the variable from the child process' environment. Note that
#: environment variables are expanded recursively, for example::

#:     env VAR1=a
#:     env VAR2=${HOME}/${VAR1}/b

#: The value of VAR2 will be <path to home directory>/a/b.

# watcher

#: Path to python file which will be loaded for watchers
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/#watchers>. Can be
#: specified more than once to load multiple watchers. The watchers
#: will be added to every kitty window. Relative paths are resolved
#: relative to the kitty config directory. Note that reloading the
#: config will only affect windows created after the reload.

# exe_search_path

#: Control where kitty finds the programs to run. The default search
#: order is: First search the system wide PATH, then ~/.local/bin and
#: ~/bin. If still not found, the PATH defined in the login shell
#: after sourcing all its startup files is tried. Finally, if present,
#: the PATH specified by the env option is tried.

#: This option allows you to prepend, append, or remove paths from
#: this search order. It can be specified multiple times for multiple
#: paths. A simple path will be prepended to the search order. A path
#: that starts with the + sign will be append to the search order,
#: after ~/bin above. A path that starts with the - sign will be
#: removed from the entire search order. For example::

#:     exe_search_path /some/prepended/path
#:     exe_search_path +/some/appended/path
#:     exe_search_path -/some/excluded/path

# update_check_interval 24

#: The interval to periodically check if an update to kitty is
#: available (in hours). If an update is found, a system notification
#: is displayed informing you of the available update. The default is
#: to check every 24 hours, set to zero to disable. Update checking is
#: only done by the official binary builds. Distro packages or source
#: builds do not do update checking. Changing this option by reloading
#: the config is not supported.

# startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session =none command line option
#: for individual instances. See sessions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#sessions> in the kitty
#: documentation for details. Note that relative paths are interpreted
#: with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment variables
#: in the path are expanded. Changing this option by reloading the
#: config is not supported.

# clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: possible actions are: write-clipboard, read-clipboard, write-
#: primary, read-primary, read-clipboard-ask, read-primary-ask. The
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the
#: clipboard. Note that disabling the read confirmation is a security
#: risk as it means that any program, even the ones running on a
#: remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_max_size.

# clipboard_max_size 512

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. A value of
#: zero means no size limit is applied. See also clipboard_control.

# file_transfer_confirmation_bypass

#: The password that can be supplied to the file transfer kitten
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/transfer/> to skip the
#: transfer confirmation prompt. This should only be used when
#: initiating transfers from trusted computers, over trusted networks
#: or encrypted transports, as it allows any programs running on the
#: remote machine to read/write to the local filesystem, without
#: permission.

# allow_hyperlinks yes

#: Process hyperlink escape sequences (OSC 8). If disabled OSC 8
#: escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise they become clickable
#: links, that you can click with the mouse or by using the hints
#: kitten <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/hints/>. The
#: special value of ask means that kitty will ask before opening the
#: link when clicked.

# Disable automatic shell integration; I handle it manually in my own zshrc files
# See https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/ for details.
shell_integration disabled

# allow_cloning ask

#: Control whether programs running in the terminal can request new
#: windows to be created. The canonical example is clone-in-kitty
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/#clone-shell>.
#: By default, kitty will ask for permission for each clone request.
#: Allowing cloning unconditionally gives programs running in the
#: terminal (including over SSH) permission to execute arbitrary code,
#: as the user who is running the terminal, on the computer that the
#: terminal is running on.

# clone_source_strategies venv,conda,env_var,path

#: Control what shell code is sourced when running clone-in-kitty in
#: the newly cloned window. The supported strategies are:

#: venv
#:     Source the file $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate. This is used by the
#:     Python stdlib venv module and allows cloning venvs automatically.
#: conda
#:     Run conda activate $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV. This supports the virtual
#:     environments created by conda.
#: env_var
#:     Execute the contents of the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_CODE with eval.
#: path
#:     Source the file pointed to by the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_PATH.

#: This option must be a comma separated list of the above values.
#: Only the first valid match, in the order specified, is sourced.

# notify_on_cmd_finish never

#: Show a desktop notification when a long-running command finishes
#: (needs shell_integration). The possible values are:

#: never
#:     Never send a notification.

#: unfocused
#:     Only send a notification when the window does not have keyboard focus.

#: invisible
#:     Only send a notification when the window both is unfocused and not visible
#:     to the user, for example, because it is in an inactive tab or its OS window
#:     is not currently active.

#: always
#:     Always send a notification, regardless of window state.

#: There are two optional arguments:

#: First, the minimum duration for what is considered a long running
#: command. The default is 5 seconds. Specify a second argument to set
#: the duration. For example: invisible 15. Do not set the value too
#: small, otherwise a command that launches a new OS Window and exits
#: will spam a notification.

#: Second, the action to perform. The default is notify. The possible
#: values are:

#: notify
#:     Send a desktop notification.

#: bell
#:     Ring the terminal bell.

#: command
#:     Run a custom command. All subsequent arguments are the cmdline to run.

#: Some more examples::

#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 5 seconds in an unfocused window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish unfocused
#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0
#:     # Ring a bell when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 bell
#:     # Run 'notify-send' when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 command notify-send job finished

term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on "Stack Overflow"
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

# forward_stdio no

#: Forward STDOUT and STDERR of the kitty process to child processes
#: as file descriptors 3 and 4. This is useful for debugging as it
#: allows child processes to print to kitty's STDOUT directly. For
#: example, echo hello world >&3 in a shell will print to the parent
#: kitty's STDOUT. When enabled, this also sets the
#: KITTY_STDIO_FORWARDED=3 environment variable so child processes
#: know about the forwarding.

# menu_map

#: Specify entries for various menus in kitty. Currently only the
#: global menubar on macOS is supported. For example::

#:    menu_map global "Actions::Launch something special" launch --hold --type=os-window sh -c "echo hello world"

#: This will create a menu entry named "Launch something special" in
#: an "Actions" menu in the macOS global menubar. Sub-menus can be
#: created by adding more levels separated by the :: characters.

#: OS specific tweaks {{{

# wayland_titlebar_color system

#: The color of the kitty window's titlebar on Wayland systems with
#: client side window decorations such as GNOME. A value of system
#: means to use the default system color, a value of background means
#: to use the background color of the currently active window and
#: finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red.

# macos_titlebar_color system

#: The color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value of
#: system means to use the default system color, light or dark can
#: also be used to set it explicitly. A value of background means to
#: use the background color of the currently active window and finally
#: you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red. WARNING:
#: This option works by using a hack when arbitrary color (or
#: background) is configured, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it.
#: It sets the background color of the entire window and makes the
#: titlebar transparent. As such it is incompatible with
#: background_opacity. If you want to use both, you are probably
#: better off just hiding the titlebar with hide_window_decorations.

# macos_option_as_alt no

#: Use the Option key as an Alt key on macOS. With this set to no,
#: kitty will use the macOS native Option+Key to enter Unicode
#: character behavior. This will break any Alt+Key keyboard shortcuts
#: in your terminal programs, but you can use the macOS Unicode input
#: technique. You can use the values: left, right or both to use only
#: the left, right or both Option keys as Alt, instead. Note that
#: kitty itself always treats Option the same as Alt. This means you
#: cannot use this option to configure different kitty shortcuts for
#: Option+Key vs. Alt+Key. Also, any kitty shortcuts using
#: Option/Alt+Key will take priority, so that any such key presses
#: will not be passed to terminal programs running inside kitty.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_hide_from_tasks no

#: Hide the kitty window from running tasks on macOS (⌘+Tab and the
#: Dock). Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

# macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

#: Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed on macOS.
#: By default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as
#: is the expected behavior on macOS.

# macos_window_resizable yes

#: Disable this if you want kitty top-level OS windows to not be
#: resizable on macOS.

# macos_thicken_font 0

#: Draw an extra border around the font with the given width, to
#: increase legibility at small font sizes on macOS. For example, a
#: value of 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-
#: pixel antialiasing at common font sizes. Note that in modern kitty,
#: this option is obsolete (although still supported). Consider using
#: text_composition_strategy instead.

# macos_traditional_fullscreen no

#: Use the macOS traditional full-screen transition, that is faster,
#: but less pretty.

# macos_show_window_title_in all

#: Control where the window title is displayed on macOS. A value of
#: window will show the title of the currently active window at the
#: top of the macOS window. A value of menubar will show the title of
#: the currently active window in the macOS global menu bar, making
#: use of otherwise wasted space. A value of all will show the title
#: in both places, and none hides the title. See
#: macos_menubar_title_max_length for how to control the length of the
#: title in the menu bar.

# macos_menubar_title_max_length 0

#: The maximum number of characters from the window title to show in
#: the macOS global menu bar. Values less than one means that there is
#: no maximum limit.

# macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: Use a custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see on both
#: light and dark backgrounds. Nowadays, the default macOS cursor
#: already comes with a white border. WARNING: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual GPU machines. Changing this option
#: by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_colorspace srgb

#: The colorspace in which to interpret terminal colors. The default
#: of srgb will cause colors to match those seen in web browsers. The
#: value of default will use whatever the native colorspace of the
#: display is. The value of displayp3 will use Apple's special
#: snowflake display P3 color space, which will result in over
#: saturated (brighter) colors with some color shift. Reloading
#: configuration will change this value only for newly created OS
#: windows.

# linux_display_server auto

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.
