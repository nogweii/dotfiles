print [ -abcDilmnNoOpPrsSz ] [ -u n ] [ -f format ] [ -C cols ]
  [ -R [ -en ]] [ arg ... ]
       With  the `-f' option the arguments are printed as described by printf.  With no flags or with the flag `-', the argum
       put as described by echo, with the following differences: the escape sequence `\M-x' metafies the character x (sets th
       control  character  (`\C-@'  and  `\C-?'  give  the characters NUL and delete), and `\E' is a synonym for `\e'.  Final
       escapes the following character and is not printed.

       -a     Print arguments with the column incrementing first.  Only useful with the -c and -C options.

       -b     Recognize all the escape sequences defined for the bindkey command, see zshzle(1).

       -c     Print the arguments in columns.  Unless -a is also given, arguments are printed with the row incrementing first

       -C cols
              Print the arguments in cols columns.  Unless -a is also given, arguments are printed with the row incrementing 

       -D     Treat the arguments as directory names, replacing prefixes with ~ expressions, as appropriate.

       -i     If given together with -o or -O, sorting is performed case-independently.

       -l     Print the arguments separated by newlines instead of spaces.

       -m     Take the first argument as a pattern (should be quoted), and remove it from the argument list together with sub
              this pattern.

       -n     Do not add a newline to the output.

       -N     Print the arguments separated and terminated by nulls.

       -o     Print the arguments sorted in ascending order.

       -O     Print the arguments sorted in descending order.

       -p     Print the arguments to the input of the coprocess.

       -P     Perform prompt expansion (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1)).

       -r     Ignore the escape conventions of echo.

       -R     Emulate  the  BSD  echo  command, which does not process escape sequences unless the -e flag is given.  The -n 
              Only the -e and -n flags are recognized after -R; all other arguments and options are printed.

       -s     Place the results in the history list instead of on the standard output.  Each argument to the print command is
              tory, regardless of its content.

       -S     Place  the  results  in  the  history list instead of on the standard output.  In this case only a single argum
              words as if it were a full shell command line.  The effect is similar to reading the line from a history file w

       -u n   Print the arguments to file descriptor n.

       -z     Push the arguments onto the editing buffer stack, separated by spaces.

       If any of `-m', `-o' or `-O' are used in combination with `-f' and there are no arguments (after the removal process i
       printed.

pushln [ arg ... ]
       Equivalent to print -nz.
