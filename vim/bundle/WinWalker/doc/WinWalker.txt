  Features:                                            *WW_Features* {{{~

	-	Navigate and manage windows and layouts with blinding speed!

	-	Multiple window operations are faster and easier because it creates
		a window navigation and management mode where all window commands
		are familiar single chars,  i.e.  h,H,^H  and j,J,^J  etc.  If you
		weren't using Vim in full-screen mode, you'll start considering it.

	-	More added functionality:

		-	Better [im]movability:

			-	Enhanced push/drag for windows and buffers.

			-	Push/drag/exchange buffers between windows, and windows
				between tabs.  Use adjacent tabs as if they were extensions
				of the current visible screen.
			
			-	Constrained size and placement.  Windows can be 'attached'
				to walls or other windows.  Windows will resize to preset
				values as you move into them.  

			-	Windows can follow focus into new tabs.

		-	Explore buffer list, and quick search/jump to any window in any
			tab by giving the first unique char(s).  It jumps to a buffer's
			window, instead of the default action of editing buffers in the
			current window.


		-	More intuitive for many operations:
			
			-	Incremental resizing is easier, using the [HJKL] and
				[^h^j^k^l].

			-	Resize in the direction specified, unlike  wincmd + - < > 

			-	Windows move/push past each other more like you'd expect.
				They can push 'between', instead of just 'maximize at far
				side'.

		-	Other usability stuff:

			-	A window-level jump list for ^I/^O  movement.

			-	O/^O  as a tab-capable alternative to ^Wo .

			-	Various shortcuts to help keep you from breaking your
				stride, i.e. to  :edit,  :ex  mode, sessions, macros, remapping

	-	All the commands are presented as a prompt menu in the command line
		so forgetting stuff isn't a problem.

	-	Many of the commands are the same as the default Vim window  ^W  and
		'wincmd' for easy transition, others are shifted around to be more
		consistent.

	-	Different invocation modes:  |WW_timeoutlen| for menu, key
		pass-through.  The goal is to have the menu mode there when you
		want it, and keep quiet otherwise.  Experiment with the different
		methods to find what works best for you.  Particularly useful for
		^W^P   ^W^O  ^W^I  ^W/   etc.

  Useful Examples:                                            *WW_Useful_Examples* {{{~

	... Or, 'How is this going to help me?'


	Ergonomics:

		Overall speed dealing with multiple windows.  Try it out:

		-	Start the WinWalker menu, ^W
		-	Open a new tab with  'N'
		-	Open a few windows with  'n' and 'v'
		-	Jump around a little with  '[hljk]'
		-	Put some files in them with 'e'
		-	Push some around with '[HLJK]'
		-	Smack them all down with 'q'

		By now you should have a feel for the difference it makes to have
		single keys to deal with the window system.


	AutoResizing:

		-	Your screen/terminal/GUI size will no longer cramp your style.
			Create windows that are always big enough.

			Example:  You have several windows open, vertical and
			horizontal, which you set to 80 columns, but you only have
			120 or whatever.

			-	Quickly visit each window, set the dimensions with 'c'.
				See |WW_Misc_Menu| => |WW_presets| if you want to change
				the values.
			
			-	For more individualized sizing,  'grow' the window to
				whatever size makes sense, and use the
				|WW_Attach_Constrain_Menu| -> lc 'lock columns' (and/or
				'll') command to cause the window to resize itself to the
				current size each time it is entered.

			Now all those windows will resize themselves each time they are
			entered.

	Templates:

	-	Store a tab to a session with the windows arranged how you
		want.

	-	Create a macro key to retrieve the template like:

		<F2>	srsessname^M

				s				save menu
				 r				restore
				  sessname		name of the session (without Session. or .vim )
						  ^M	literal carriage return, with ^V^M or ^Q^M
					

	Keeping Track Of Buffers:

		If you're using TabLineSet.vim with the verbose option, you'll be
		able to see all open buffers in the tabline (especially if you have
		the 'Tabline wrapping patch' installed).

		The find, '/', command will show you all loaded buffers, or '?' for
		all buffers.

   See Also:  |WW_Other|


	To do :  Better tab-to-tab navigation. (^I, ^O, wrapping, /find )
	To do :  Creating Layouts with attachments and locked sizes.

	Initial Set Up:                                 *WW_Initial_Set_Up* {{{~

		-	Unzip the distribution file above your plugin to extract:
>
				plugin/WinWalker.vim
				plugin/Char_menu.vim
				doc/WinWalker.txt
<

		-	Set up a key map.  I.e.
>
				nmap <silent> <Leader>w :call WinWalkerMenu()<CR>
<
					Default.  I like it mapped to ^W, since I'm used to
					hitting ^W for windows stuff, and WinWalker is mostly a
					superset of the standard ^W/wincmd commands.

		-	Look through the |WW_Misc_Menu| and |WW_Customizing| for other
			options to change.

                             Commands:                   *WW_Commands*  {{{~


	Starting:                                          *WW_Starting*   {{{~

				Assuming you decide to map ^W :
>
		nnoremap <silent> <C-W> :call WinWalkerMenu()<CR>
<
			<C-W>

				-	Type <C-W> and note the delay (~1/2 sec) before the menu
					starts.  

				-	Type <C-W>j (or whatever) fast together, and it
					should move down one window without starting the menu.  

				-	Decide whether you want more or less time to type the
					second char before the menu starts.  

				-	Change the timeoutlen in {m}isc
					menu -> {t}imeoutlent ( |WW_timeoutlen| ).

			<C-W><SPACE>

				This starts the menu immediately without the initial
				timeoutlen.  (For us impatient people :-)  Set timeoutlen to 0
				for a similar effect.

			See also |WW_Customizing|


}}}


	Main Menu:										 *WW_Main_Menu* {{{~


		{w}/{W}/{<C-W>}indow=>Nxt/Prv				*WW_window_next_prev*

				Move through the window list, same as default behavior.


		{k}/{K}/{<C-K>}=up							*WW_movement*
		{j}/{J}/{<C-J>}=down
		{h}/{H}/{<C-H>}=left
		{l}/{L}/{<C-L>}=right

				There are three general kinds of move operations with Vim
				windows that are handled here:  
				1)	moving a cursor from one window into another, 
				2)	moving a buffer from one window to another, without
					creating or destroying windows , 
				3)	moving a window (and its buffer and cursor) to a new
					location, causing the layout to rearrange.
				
				*	See |WW_grow| for the alternation actions for these
					keys when 'grow' mode is on.

				The above key commands are set up along those lines:

			-	Lowercase='move cursor to another window'
			-	Uppercase='push the current window up/down/left/right'
			-	Control='exchange buffers, keep focus with buffer'
				(when exchanging to an adjacent tab, it relocates the
				buffer into a new window, since it's more confusing
				otherwise).
			-	Arrow keys are mapped to analogous [jkhl] commands, i.e.
				<S-UP> is mapped to 'K'.


		{r}/{R}=rotate wins/buffers					*WW_rotate*

			{r}	Rotates the current window according to new/vnew.  It isn't
				smart about detecting the orientation of a window it
				hasn't seen before, so you might have to hit "r" twice to
				get it started.

			{R}	Rotate all the buffers around the windows in the screen
				without changing the window layout.

		{o}/{O}='only'/clone					*WW_only_clone*

			{o}	The default 'wincmd' behavior where all windows are closed
				but the current.  
				
			{O}	Clone the current buffer in it's own new tab.  This is for
				when you want to temporarily maximize the current window
				without changing any others.  If <C-O> ( <C-W><C-O> from Vim
				Normal ) is the first command used to leave, it will close the
				window, and return to the origination.
			
												*WW_Jump_list*
		{<C-I>}/{<C-O>}=jump forward/back

				The jump list is a history of windows visited.  It
				traverses WinWalker's window-level jump list.  (As opposed
				to the Vim Normal mode ^I/^O, which traverses a
				buffer-level jump list.)

				^I moves the jump list index forward toward a higher, more
				recent jump number.

				^O moves the jump list index backward toward a lower, older
				jump number.
				
				If you move to a different window when the jump list index
				isn't at the end, the new window jump point will be
				inserted into the list.  The list manager will prune
				invalid jump points when they are encountered by ^I or ^O.

				See |WW_Misc_Menu| -> |WW_Jump_list_display| to inspect the
				jump list, or go directly to a specific jump number.

		{t}ab menu
			
				Submenu for handling tabs.  See |WW_Tab_Menu|

		Window {a}ttach/Constrain menu

				Submenu for setting windows attachments, fixed sizing, etc.
				See |WW_Attach_Constrain_Menu|

		{m}isc menu
				
				Submenu for setting options.  See |WW_Misc_Menu|

		{s}ave/restore menu

				Submenu for saving sessions.  See |WW_Save_Menu|
				( ^S and ^R macros are set by default to
				quicksave/restore.  See |WW_Macro_keys| .)


		{g}row        *WW_grow*  *WW_resize*

				Toggles 'grow' mode where the shift- and control- of [jkhl]
				keys are changed to do window resizing.  This toggle in the
				|WW_Misc_Menu|, but is also at the top level for convenience.

			[JKHL]
				Grow the window one line/col in the given direction.  I.e
				(remember, 'l' is Vim for 'right', and 'h' is Vim for
				'left' ) for win1 'L' will increase the width by 1, and 'H'
				will decrease by 1, and the opposite will happen for win2:
>
				---------------
				|     L|->    |
				|win1  |      |
				|    <-|H     |
				---------------
				---------------
				|     L|->    |
				|      |  win2|
				|    <-|H     |
				---------------
<
				The [JKHL] and arrow keys attempt to 'grow' the window in
				that direction, not just shrink or expand like wincmd + - <
				>  .  Hopefully others will find this more intuitive, as I
				do.  The exception is for windows between other windows,
				where the directional keys become ambiguous, in which case a
				default action is done.

			^J^K^H^L
				Grow the window more quickly (I picked a couple values
				which seemed about right...not real scientific).
				

				This option is reset each time WinWalkerMenu() is called
				from Vim Normal mode via ^W or whatever.
				
												*WW_New_edit_etc*
		{n}ew win
		{v}ert new

				Same as  :new  and  :vnew  .

		{=}equalize windows						*WW_equalize*

				Same as Vim default.

		{:}ex									*WW_ex_passthrough*

				Prompts for a command and transfers it to  :ex  to execute.
				Saves time exiting and re-entering the menu.

		{e}dit									*WW_edit_passthrough*
				A shortcut to |:edit| without exiting the menu first.

		{/}{?}find win							*WW_find_window*

				Submenu of available/loaded buffers.  Typing the first one or
				so unique leading characters jumps to the matched window.
				Buffer name or number can be selected. {?} includes hidden
				buffer names.

		{c}olumn preset ( lines, cols, actually)	|WW_presets|

				A quick set option to resize the current window to user's
				preferred working dimensions, I.e. 80 columns, and 15 lines.

													*WW_Quitting*
		:{q}uit/:{Q}uit!/{<C-Q>}=tabclose!/{Z}Z
				
				Sends various quit commands.

		{<SPACE>}/{<ESC>}=>Exit

				Exit the WinWalker subsytem.  <C-C> and <BS> also work.  If
				<C-W><SPACE>, <C-W><C-SPACE>, <C-W><CR>, <C-W><C-CR> are
				entered before the timeoutlen (before the menu starts), it
				the reverse effect, and bypasses the timeoutlen, and starts
				the menu immediately.

		Any other keys

				... are delivered to Normal mode, and the menu exits.  So,
				typing ^U, ^D, ^F, ^B  exits WinWalker, and scroll the
				window.

	Attach/Constrain Menu:                        *WW_Attach_Constrain_Menu*   {{{~

		lines/{c}olumns preset		*WW_presets*

				The preset is used create a standard workable size for a
				window.  It is most useful when creating and moving around
				a layout with multiple windows.  This will prompt for
				{lines,cols}.  It is triggered by the 'c' command at the
				top level.

		{ll}/{lc} lock-lines/cols
				
				Lock the height or width at the current value.
				
		{a}ttach
				
				Attach the window to walls or other windows.

				An attachment tells the window to seek a position next to a
				wall or another window, but doesn't create any bond with
				other window, meaning the attachment won't 'pull' the other
				window.

				The best way to decrease conflicts is to set the minimum
				number of constraints possible.  Vim windows can have
				constraints of their own which can interferWinWalkerWinWalker
				e with WinWalkers (i.e. if you have two windows, one atop
				the other, Vim causes them to share the same width, so
				different WinWalker 'locked' column values won't result in
				windows with different widths).

				The placement routine is fairly simplistic, and will have
				trouble with many windows and constraints, particularly
				because Vim's native placement can fight back.

				There can be cases when there are no direct conflicts, but
				there are a lot of windows open, and doing the auto-resize
				for locked line/col values will fight with the Vim default
				window size minimums.

				There are some cases where the auto-resizing won't work
				immediately, i.e. a window is trying to resize itself to a
				locked value, and it is adjacent to the current/cursor
				window, then the minimum Vim value for the current window
				will take precedence.  Typing '=' in some other window can
				give all windows a chance to update properly.

				There are some cases that aren't handled:

				-	A window attached to walls up/down or left/right will
					not necessarily allow windows to 'push' (JKHL)
					past it.  

					The exchange (^J^K^H^L) command is the right choice for
					this, and similar move-past situations.
				
				-	If win1 is attached upwards to the top wall, and you're
					trying to 'push' win2 which is adjacent to win1, it can
					fail depending on the rotation of win2 (which causes it
					to always try to push win2 over win1).

	Misc Menu:                                        *WW_Misc_Menu* {{{~


		{g}row						*WW_grow_toggle*

			Toggle whether the [jkhl] uppercase and control keys are used
			to resize windows.

		{w}rap						*WW_screen_wrap_type*

			Set wrap behavior:
				None :	default Vim
				Win :	wrap at top/bottom/left/right sides of screen
				tabs :	wrap into adjacent tabs at R/L sides of screen

		{me}nu							*WW_menu_verbose_level*

			Set whether full prompt is shown for the main menu.

		{h}ighlight current win 		*WW_highlight_current_window*

			Toggle highlighting of the current window.  The highlighting is
			done to help distinguish which window is current, since the
			cursor won't be visible.

		{e}mpty files					*WW_empty_files*

			Same as highlighting, above, but add some text to empty files
			to help distinguish as current window.

		{t}imeoutlen  					*WW_timeoutlen*

			Set the timeoutlen used for the wait for the key press after ^W
			(or whatever) in Vim Normal mode.  If the second key is
			received before the timeoutlen, the command is executed and
			control returns immediately to Vim Normal.  If timeoutlen is
			reached, the main menu starts and subsequent commands require
			only one key.  Control is kept by WinWalker until the menu is
			exited.

			It is analogous to the Vim |timeoutlen|, but it is an
			independent internal value.

			This also affects the timeoutlen for ambiguous matches in the
			{/}find command (using the Char_menu function).

		{mt}imeoutlen  					*WW_mtimeoutlen*

			Set the timeoutlen used for menu entries which match partial
			entries, i.e. if the find menu had {win} and {WinWalker}, and
			you typed 'win', it will return 'win' unless you type 'walker'
			before mtimeoutlen milliseconds.

		{j}ump list						*WW_Jump_list_display*

			Show the window-level jump list (like |:jumps| ).

		{k}ey remap						*WW_key_remap*

			Remap single keys.  No nesting.

		{d}ropout keys					*WW_Dropout_keys*

			Change keys in the list which causes the main menu to exit
			after execution.  This is most useful for when |WW_timeoutlen|
			is set to 0.  See |WW_Customizing|

		{ma}cro keys      				*WW_Macro_keys*
			
			Use this to create single key mappings to key sequence macros
			(like the Vim 'normal' command') that are given to:
>
				call feedkeys( sequence, 't' )
<
			At the moment, if you want to enter a special/control char, use
			^V or ^Q to escape it.

			Examples :
>
				1		vemyfile^Mc
						Bring up your favorite file in a new window:
							vertical new, edit 'myfile', resize to preset

				2		/WinWalker^M^C
						Jump to your favorite window from anywhere.  In this
						example 'W' matches 'WinWalker' since it's the only
						buffer starting with 'w' in my current buffer list,
						and 'inWalker' is discarded (^M,^C,<ESC>,' '
						delimit the discard end).  ^C quits (or ' ', etc.)
						and leaves the 'WinWalker' window/buffer open.

				<F2>	Nsrmysession^M 
						Bring up your favorite screen/tab layout:
						new tab, save menu, restore 'mysession'

				Directory to hold the Session files.  Default is |$HOME|.

		{s}ave session
				
				Save the current session with 'tabpages' session option to the
				file prompted for, using the above directory as the starting
				point.  Any filename can be used, but the prefix 'Session.' is
				used as a default to help filter the completion list more
				quickly.  If the completion key (^D or <TAB>) is pressed when
				only a single file can be completed, a summary is show, per

	Customizing:                                     *WW_Customizing* {{{~

		-	g:WinWalker_opts.rc_file  sets the filename for the options
			settings.  Default is  $HOME/.WInWalker.vim .  Most of the
			global option variables are handled here, so they don't need to
			go into your .vimrc.  The  g:WinWalker_opts.rc_file  file is
			sourced once only, when the plugin is first read when Vim
			starts up.
		
		-	Highlighting overrides can be done by copying the  s:Hi_init()
			function into your  .vimrc , and making changes there. 

		-	You can set certain keys to drop out of (bypass) the menu
			automatically and return to Vim Normal mode with this var:
>				
				let g:WinWalker_dropout_keys = [ "\<C-W>", "\<C-P>" ]
<


			This is most useful for when timeoutlen is set to 0.  For example:

			With timeoutlen > 0, typing ^W^W fast from Vim Normal mode will
			move to the next window without starting the menu.

			With timeoutlen = 0, the first  ^W  will start the menu, and the
			second  ^W  will move to the next window, and then leave you back
			in the menu, regardless of how fast you type them.

			With  ^W  set in the dropout keys list,  ^W^W  from Vim Normal
			mode will behave the same regardless of timeoutlen.  If you set
			it up this way, the following are handy for moving around
			outside the menu mode:
>
				nnoremap <silent> <tab> :call Tab_jump_or_win_move()<CR>
				nmap <silent> <S-Tab> <C-W><C-P>
				nnoremap <silent> <c-tab> :tabnext<CR>
				nnoremap <silent> <s-c-tab> :tabprev<CR>
<

		-	Single keys can be remapped inside WinWalker via the
			g:WinWalker_remap  dict var.  You can put it into your .vimrc,
			but it probably easier to use it through the |WW_Misc_Menu|

{{{	*WW_Notes_Other_Bugs*


	Notes:     *WW_Notes* ~

	-	Since this uses Vim7 tabs extensively, see  TabLineSet.vim  for
		better visual information in the tabs themselves.

	-	Don't map a key that also has other operator-pending maps, i.e.
		trying to map  ^W  while there were still other mappings like
		custom  ^W^O  will cause it to wait (forever, possibly) for the
		second key, which keeps the main menu from starting.

	-	Removing a tab, or re-arranging windows can invalidate parts of the
		jumplist, which will become somewhat unpredictable until it clears
		all the bad jumps as they are encountered.

	-	Some apps like 'Taglist' and 'quickfix window' set 'bufhidden',
		which interferes with window moving/exchanging.  This is mostly
		dealt with, but other app.s like 'Project.vim' reset the window
		every time the buffer is entered, which isn't handled (probably
		can't be without changing the application itself).


	Caveats:  *WW_Caveats*  ~
		
		Here will be listed things to keep in mind if problems should ever
		crop up.

	-	The tag jump keys are remapped for Help file types to go through the
		WinWalker_help_tag_trap().  This should in general be an improvement,
		but side any effects aren't known yet as of v1.3.


	Bugs Etc:  *WW_Bugs*  ~

	-	The cmdheight isn't always restored correctly at this time.  As of
		Vim70c, a bug exists for setting/resetting the value in different
		tabs.  It seems to be better with 70d, but not all cmdheight issues
		are resolved.

	-	New windows are inheriting set_fixed_lines/cols.

	-	As of Vim70d, there is a problem with using <expr>, so this form:

			nnoremap <expr> <c-w> WinWalkerMenu()

		does not allow subsequent mappings like:

			nmap <s-up> <c-w>g<c-k>

		use instead,

			nnoremap <silent> <c-w> :call WinWalkerMenu()<CR>
