If you found this plugin useful or you have any kind of problems with running
it or some ideas to share, you are cordially invited to write to me:

=============================================================================
			    ABSTRACT ~

This is a filetype plugin for Vim to comfortably write [TeX], [LaTeX],
 [PdfLaTeX],...  documents, which provides functionality not met in other
plugins. It makes you [FREE] from compiling procedure, making this process
automatic using autocommands. It also provides useful mappings and other
many other commands: to analyse your .log file, to see the table contents, to
search for a label, to search in bib files or to find a macro definition
matching a pattern, or even to find and preview fonts in your tex
distribution. The features include a multi-functional tab completion for:
commands, environment names, packages, input files, bib files, bst files,
colours, closing brackets and environments (preserves nesting),... etc. To
have full functionality you need: python (with nonstandard psutil library, see
|atp-requirements-python| how to get it), pdffonts available in the package
'app-text/poppler' (at least in Gentoo).  Another good tool is texdoc, which
is a part of TexLive - these days standard TeX distribution for Linux, and
MikTeX on Windows.
==============================================================================

FEATURES INCLUDE: ~
-----------------
* background compilation, debugging modes, progress bar

NEWS							*atp-news*

 ======================
 Changes in version 9.6.1
<
  The main work was to make ATP web page: http://atp-vim.sf.net with proper
  html version of documentation at http://atp-vim.sf.net/help.html.

  New imaps added: see |atp-imap-diacritics|. Read also paragraph before
  |atp-imap-math|. The command atp-:ToggleMathIMaps is now called
  |atp-:ToggleIMaps| and also toggles |atp-imap-diacritics|.

  I added to doc section about latexmk interface: |atp-:Latexmk|,
  |atp-:LatexmkStatus|, |atp-:LatexmkClear|, |atp-:LatexmkStop|. The LatexBox
  commands :LatexmkForce, :LatexmkStatusDetailed and :LatexmkClearAll are
  simulated with bang.

  imap ++ \sum	(which can be turned off with :ToggleIMaps or '<Tab> imap and
  nmap)

  Several small fixes (thanks to user reports on the |atp-mailing-list|!)
>
 ======================
 Changes in version 9.6
<
  Some functions where rewritten in python making ATP much faster.

  ATP loads 1/3 faster (after first run when you save project file, which is
  done when you save your file!).

  Use g:atp_no_local_abbreviations if you don't want to have abbreviations to
  locally defined environments (this takes time if your vim was compiled
  without |+python| feature, as it runs |atp-:LocalCommands| command - which
  is slow in this case). 

  Note: the python version of LocalCommands will save the current buffer,
  without saving project script and with 'nowritebackup' and 'nobackup' set. 

  I added |b:atp_LocalEnvironments|, |b:atp_LocalCommands| and
  |b:atp_LocalColors| to |g:atp_ProjectLocalVariables| if vim doesn't have
  |+python| feature otherwise |g:atp_local_completion| is set to 2, hence
  |atp-:LocalCommands| is run with |BufEnter|. It is so because the function
  LocalCommands was written also in python which is more than 10 times faster
  than the old vim implementation. 

  |atp-:ViewOutput| -- removed the [sync] argument.

  |atp-:BibSearch| is written in python. It is much faster. Thus the argument
  should be a python regular expression. If you want to use vim script (and
  vim regular expression) set |g:atp_bibsearch|="vim". Then both Tab
  Completion and |atp-:BibSearch| will use vim code.

  Tab completion for labels (\ref and \eqref commands) gives more information
  inside the popup menu.
 
  The <F2> map is back -- it turns on/off <space> cmap to \_s\+. But this time
  this map by default is turned on. It is made to it doesn't interact with
  other command modes than / and ?. If you want to turn in off/on use <F2>. If
  you want to turn it off in your |vimrc| or |atprc| files use: >
    let g:atp_cmap_space = 0
< Pressing <F2> will define this map.


  Some other small fixes.

>
 ======================
 Changes in version 9.5
<

    The keys |j|, |k|, |gj| and |gk| are no longer mapped by ATP. There is a better 
    solution for updating the Table of Contents highlighted line. It is done
    using autocommand CursorHold.

    See the new command |atp-:Tags|.
							|atp-:Dsearch|
:Dsearch
    This used to be :DefiSearch. This I found more in vim style.
    Also |g:atp_DsearchMaxWindowHeight| is used instead of
    g:atp_DefiSearchMaxWindowHeight.

|g:atp_statusOutDir| fixed.
|g:atp_IMapCC| instead of g:atp_MapCC.

And bunch of other fixes :).

TIP ~
    Checkout cmdalias plugin (vimscript#745). It lets define lower case
    aliases to commands. You can put in your |atprc| file:
	Alias tex TEX
	Alias toc TOC

 ======================
 Changes in version 9.4
<

ATP AND GENTOO LINUX~
    Thanks to Tim Harder there is a gentoo ebuild, if you use gentoo check for
    automatictexplugin in the portage tree.

COMPLETION ~
    Small but nice change in closing environments: If you type
    \begin{envname}<Tab> the cursor position will not change. You can use
    |i_CTRL-M| (|i_CTRL-J| is used by |atp-j_motion|) after <Tab> to open new
    line inside {envname}.  Otherwise the cursor position will be right after
    the closing \end{envname}.

LOCAL COMMANDS ~
    |atp-:LocalCommands|	  -- do not search in comments, 
				-- add single { if command has defined arguments.

    Note: the format of viewer options has changed from a string to a vim
    list.  Every option and its value should be placed as a separate element
    of vim list.  See |atp-Viewers_Options| for examples.

NEW IMAPS ~
    New imaps for some commonly used math commands: see |atp-imap-math|. 

    All mathematical imaps: for symbols, greek letters, are defined only when
    inside LaTeX (or TeX) mathematical environment. 

    There is new predefined layout for environment imaps available, but
    disabled by default. If you like longer and more intuitive environment
    insert mode maps set |g:atp_ShortEnvIMaps|=0 in your |vimrc| or |atprc|
    files. Use |atp-:HelpEnvIMaps| to see them. There is also one new
    environment ]let in this new layout which inputs a letter environment. If
    you want a short imap for it you can set g:atp_imap_letter="w" and ATP
    will make a map ]w for it.  Note that "l", and "L" are already taken and
    using "le" will slow down "l", also "e" and "r" are used, so there is no
    good choice for it. You can set |g:atp_letter_opening| and
    |g:atp_letter_closing| to customize default opening and closing
    statements.

    If you decide to use short imaps (the default) there is one change: ]i is
    mapped to \item and ]I is mapped to itemize environment (this is the only
    type of change in the short layout. In long layout ]I is mapped ot \item
    and ]ite is mapped to itemize environment.

    There is also a small change with <Tab> completion: after typing
    \begin{envname}<Tab> the cursor will not move, so you can use |i_CTRL-M|
    to open new line.

    The abbreviations are customizable: g:atp_imap_{envname}, also the leader
    is customizable with |g:atp_imap_third_leader| and environment names for
    example if you set |g:atp_EnvNameTheorem|="thm" then ]the imap will insert
    \begin{thm}:\end{thm} pair. You can list supported environments with ':let
    g:atp_EnvName<C-d>'. If you set g:atp_imap_{envname} to empty string ""
    the corresponding imap will not be defined.

    See also |atp-:ToggleIMaps|.

NEW MOTIONS ~
 							*atp->E* *atp-<E*
    There are two more nice map >E which is something like %>e, i.e. jump over
    the current environment and go to next one. The reverse <E is also
    implemented, thought it is not simply <e%. They do not support count
    (yet), and actually count breaks them. If you want to add |zz|, (|zt| or
    |zb|) after >E you can put this in your |atprc| file:
	map <buffer> <silent> >E	<Plug>JumptoNextEnvironmentzz
	map <buffer> <silent> <E	<Plug>JumptoPreviousEnvironmentzz

    |atp--S|, |atp--s|, |atp--c|, |atp--p| new maps for |atp-:SSec|,
    |atp-:Sec|, |atp-:Chap| and |atp-:Part|. They also works relatively to the
    current unit (section/chapter/part), i.e. 2]s will jump to second section
    of the current chapter.


UPDATETIME ~
    |g:atp_updatetime_insert| can be changed on the fly to 0 (previously it
    requires to quitting vim and making changes in |vimrc|/|atprc| files. 
 
MAKE LATEX ~
    |atp-:MakeLatex| is rewritten in python. The "!" is not yet implemented.

PYTHON 3 compatibility ~
    All python scripts are compatible with Python 3. Traceback info is
    forwarded to vim (and log files) in case exceptions are handled.

DICTIONARIES ~
    I added extended versions of dictionaries of latex-suite to ATP (the files
    dictionaries/dictionary and dictionary/SIunits). They are added to
    |'complete'| vim option, so you can use them through |ins-completion|.
    I made one more dictionary (dictionaries/ams_dictionary) with ams commands
    and environment names. It will be added to the vim |'complete'| option if
    you use amsmath package or if the document class is one of the standard
    ams classes or of |g:atp_amsmath| is set to 1.
 
STATUS LINE ~
    Status notifications has the ability to show if |b:atp_BibCompiler|, or
    "makeindex" are running. Unless |g:atp_statusNotif|=0 or
    |g:atp_callback|=0 |atp-:MakeLatex| will echo a single message when it
    returns.

    There is also new status line for QuickFix window with number of errors
    and warnings printed (this depends on |b:atp_ErrorFormat|).

BIBER AND BIBLATEX SUPPORT ~
    Support for biber and biblatex is added (in |atp-:MakeLatex|,
    |atp-:Bibtex|, |atp-:Delete|, |atp-:InputFiles| commands), |g:atp_keep|
    variable will adjust on the fly (add run.xml and bcf extensions).
    |b:atp_BibCommand| will be set to biber if the preamble contains
    \usepackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}

    If you use biblatex, it allows for putting \bibliography{} type commands
    only in the preamble. Thus ATP will search for them only there. The
    |g:atp_inputfile_pattern| might not contain any pattern for bibliographies
    (\addbibresource, \bibliography, etc.). The |atp-:InputFiles| command will
    search for them in a special subroutine which only searches in the
    preamble.  This makes it work slightly faster.

TEX OPTIONS VARIABLE (new format) ~
    |b:atp_TexOptions| is a comma separated list of TeX compiler options.
    If you use |g:atp_Compiler|="bash" this might be just a white space
    separated list.

SPACE CMAP ~						|atp-<space>|
 cmap <buffer> <C-Space> 	\_s\+
 cmap <buffer> <C-_> 		\_s\+
    The <C-Space> map doesn't work in Vim, instead <C-@> is used which works
    as <C-Space>. In Vim, and gVim as well, you can also use |atp-Q/|,
    |atp-Q?| where <Space> is mapped to \_s\+.

    Note: from version 9.6 <Space> is mapped to \_s\+ in cmdline modes / and ?.
    <F2> turns it on/off. The above maps are always on.

ERRORS ~
 nmap <LocalLeader>e
    To get list of errors with current |b:atp_ErrorFormat|.

:ErrorFormat {efm}					 |atp-:ErrorFormat|
    This is new interface to :SetErrorFormat. If {efm} is not given it will
    show the current value |b:atp_ErrorFormat|. It sets the variable
    |b:atp_ErrorFormat| and rereads the log file with |cgetfile|. The variable
    |b:atp_ErrorFormat| is also set when you use the command
    |atp-:ShowErrors|. In addition you can use +{flag} and -{flag} as an
    argument, then {flag} will be added/removed from |b:atp_ErrorFormat|.

EasyMotion and ATP ~
    If you want to use EaseMotion vim plugin (which is quite handy):
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3526
    You can set |g:atp_Compare|="". Alternatively, if you want to use the
    fastest comparing method of ATP, you can add to last line of
    s:EasyMotion() function in plugin/EasyMotion.vim add >
	    let g:atp_changedtick = b:changedtick
<   You might want to change g:EasyMotion_leader_key (see |easymotion-leader-key|
    if you have EasyMotion), because some maps of ATP are interfering with
    EasyMotion. For example "-" might be a good choice.  You can also try to
    change |maplocalleader| which is heavily used by ATP.

    Select Comments nmap and vmap is now |_c| (previously \sc was
    interfering with an ATP font map).

    (Almost all) maps became |:map-silent|.   

ATPRC ~
    The |atprc| file is now sourced twice at startup: at the beginning to set
    the variables, and once again at the end to set the maps defined in it.

QUICKFIX WINDOW ~
    Despite the status line for quick fix window, :cgetfile will be run when
    you open new files, this nicely works with :edit command but not :split if
    you want to keep the old log file in QuickFix window. If this is the case
    set >
     let g:atpcgetfile = 0
<   You can also put this in your |atprc| or |vimrc| file.

DEBUG ATP  ~
:DebugPrint	
    if you want to develop/debug ATP set g:atp_atpdev to 1 run
    |atp-:ReloadATP| and this command will allow to print (cat) debug
    files under |g:atp_TempDir|.


I hope I didn't missed anything important. If you want to see detailed changes
you can always read the svn logs at |atp-sourceforge|.

================================================================================
INSTALLATION                               		*atp-installation*

     Neccessary vim settings:
     |:filetype-plugin-on|
     |:filetype-indent-on|	(if you want to have automatic indentation for TeX files)
     |:syntax-enable|		(several features will not work properly without this option)

If you do not like colours you can still set syntax on but clear the highlight
colours (you should make a simple function which clears all the highlight
groups, because ':hi clear' will not give you what you want).

See |atp-requirements| for other  ATP requirements. 

GET ATP UPDATES ~
To get updates it is enought to use this command:
							*atp-:UpdateATP*
:UpdateATP[!]
	With bang update ATP to latest {UNSTABLE} snapshot, without to latest
	stable release. It makes a check if your version is the latest one. 
	If you have installed {UNSTABLE} snapshot and then you run :UpdateATP
	without a bang "!", then ATP will ask you if you want to DOWNGRADE to
	the last stable release.

	{UNSTABLE} snapshots contain small fixes, and rarely, major changes
	of important parts of ATP (what can produce new bugs).  

	Requires python.

							*atp-:ATPversion*
:ATPversion	
	This command prints version information of ATP and the time stamp when
	this version was build. The time stamp is in format 'dd-mm-yy_HH-MM'.

================================================================================
COMMANDS	                               		*atp-commands* *atp-:*
							
							*atp-compilation*
The main function is not seen by the user (it is called s:compiler, for those
who want to read the plugin). It executes tex compiler specified by the
variable |b:atp_TexCompiler|. It is executed as an autocommand by the line: >
	au! CursorHold $HOME*.tex silent call 's:auTeX()'
< where s:auTeX() is a simple function which calls s:compiler if the file
written on the disk and the buffer differ. There are two comparing mechanism,
the default one is using |b:changedtick-variable| , the seconds compares the
buffer with the on-disk version:
							*g:atp_Compare*
							*g:atp_compare_double_empty_lines*
							*g:atp_compare_embedded_comments*
	The default value is "changedtick". Then the |b:changedtick-variable|
	is used to find if there buffer differs and to run latex. With any other
	value a compare function will be used (which compares the buffer and
	the written file on the disk) - this method is much slower but has
	additional features: by default differences in comments are skipped
	(if you set |g:atp_compare_embedded_comments|=0 (the default is 1)
	then also the comments which do not start right at the beginning of
	line will be skipped). The second feature is to not see differences in
	amount of blank lines: two or more blank lines is the same as one
	blank line, for this set |g:atp_compare_double_empty_lines|=0, which
	is the default.

As you can see it will run if a key is not pressed during time defined by
option |'updatetime'| (see |CursorHold|) in the normal mode. If you type in
insert mode the file won't be compiled (and that's all right as you can be in the
middle of your very long formula). The value of |'updatetime'| which works
fine is around 1000ms (|'updatetime'| is set in milliseconds). Instead of
setting |'updatetime'| options directly you should set the variables
|g:atp_updatetime_insert| and |g:atp_updatetime_normal|. Here's an important
note on using CTRL-C (|i_CTRL-C|) in Vim:

							*g:atp_IMapCC*
    In vim the key combination CTRL-C (|i_CTRL-C|) in insert mode exists to
    normal without triggering the InsertLeave autocommands. In this way it
    doesn't changes the |'updatetime'| from |g:atp_updatetime_insert| to
    |g:atp_updatetime_normal|. If |g:atp_IMapCC|=1 then |_CTRL-C| is mapped to
    |i_CTRL-[| so the InsertLeave autocommands are parsed. However, it is
    a good habit to use |i_CTRL-C| while you are writting/editing and |i_CTRL-[| or
    |i_ESC| when you whish to see what you wrote (then TeX will be run
    quicker). If you follow this you can even set
    |g:atp_updatetime_normal|=1 (if you set it to 0 then the file will not
    be processed while Vim is in normal mode).

							*g:atp_updatetime_insert*
							*g:atp_updatetime_normal*
>
 g:atp_updatetime_insert = 2000							
 g:atp_updatetime_normal = 1000
< - These variables sets the value of |'updatetime'| vim option.
    Separate settings are for normal and insert mode. You can make
    |g:atp_updatetime_normal| even smaller so that the file is processed
    whenever you go out from insert mode to normal mode. These values will
    overwrite the original value of |'updatetime'| (unless you set both
    variables to 0)  so you should adjust them in order for the change to have
    an effect.

    If you set |g:atp_updatetime_insert|=0 the TeX compiler will not be called
    while Vim is in the insert mode. 

    If you set |g:atp_updatetime_normal|=0 the TeX compiler will not be called
    while Vim is in the normal mode.


Coming back to compilation ... ~

Tex compiler is run with one options:
	-output-directory 
which points to a unique temporary file in a temporary directory |b:atp_TempDir| 

						*atp-:ToggleAuTeX*
						*b:atp_autex*
You can switch off/on the function s:auTeX by pressing <S-F5> or by letting
the local to buffer variable |b:atp_autex|=1 (on) |b:atp_autex|=0 (off). It is
useful in some situations turn automatic compiling off. The key <S-F5> calls
the command |atp-:ToggleAuTeX| which sets the variable |b:atp_autex| and issue
a message. You can also set this variable to 0 for some files that are not
supposed to be processed, for example:
>
	au BufRead texmf/*.tex let b:atp_autex=0
<
On start up b:atp_autex is set to 1 if the path of opened file is not under any
tex directory ('kpsewhich -show-path tex', except the current dir). For example,
files located under your local texmf tree will have b:atp_autex=0. Also for
files with other extension than the standard "tex" it will be set to 0.

The second important variable |b:atp_TexCompiler| configures if you use TeX,
PdfTeX, LaTeX, PdfLaTeX and it should point to the program name so please do
not use capital letters.

Next variable to set is |b:atp_OutDir|. It configures where TeX
will put the output and where viewer and log analysing tools can find
appropriate files. 

The last top most important variable is |g:atp_keep| which is a list of extensions,
by default it is
    let g:atp_keep = [ "log", "aux", "toc", "bbl", "ind", "idx", "synctex.gz", 
		\ "blg", "loa", "toc", "lot", "lof", "thm", "out" ]
Files with this extension will be copied from |b:atp_OutDir| to the temporary
directory with appropriate name to be used when (La)TeX is compiling. (log file
will be only copied after it is created, other files will be copied back and
forth between you |b:atp_OutDir| and the temporary directory)

							*atp-compile.py*
There are two function compile which can compile your tex file: one written in
python (for portability reasons) and old one in bash. They work almost the
same with one small difference. The python code has some vim enhancments (for
example the progres bar).

The python code has a debug file compile.log under |g:atp_TempDir| will
contain all the errors issued by python, and 'compile.py.debug'
- debugging info printed by the |compile.py| script.

    							*g:atp_Compiler*
If for some reason you'd like to use the old 'bash' style script there is
a variable: >
	g:atp_Compiler = "python"
< just switch its value to "bash" (you don't need to restart vim).  OK, so
what is the difference: the python script uses psutil python library (probably
you need to install it, at least I had to.) It is for two purposes: to
determine if xpdf is running and secondly, more importantly to check if latex
is running. 
    							*b:atp_LatexPIDs*
The python script |compile.py| sends PID numbers of latex processes to vim
variable |b:atp_LatexPIDs|. Then the function which makes the status line for
ATP has a python code to check if the latex PIDs are still valid processes.
This is more accurate than the method used with bash compiler (before running
latex increase variable |b:atp_running| and decrease after getting signal that
latex has ended). In many situations this was failing.  The new method works
better, however it shows that latex is running after slightly longer period of
time (not that first python must run the script and then run latex). 

							*b:atp_TexReturnCode*	
The variable |b:atp_TexReturnCode| stores the return code of compilation.

See |atp-requirements-python| for nonstandard python libraries that are used
by ATP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CALL BACK AND DEBUG MODE				*atp-callback*
							*atp-debug-mode*
	By default the call back mechanism is turned on (g:atp_callback=1)

	When call back mechanism is set, which is by default if you run gui
	version, if you invoke 'vim' from command line you need to add
	'servername' variable, it might be desirable to alias Vim to to >
			vim --servername VIM 
< 	you have additional functionalities:

							*atp-status-line-notification*
	
	* Status Line Notification: status line can show if tex is running >
		    let g:atp_status_notification = 1
<		If unset you will get a message when compiler ends.
		If set the number next to the name of your compiler indicates
		how many instances are currently running. If
		|g:atp_ProgressBar|=1 then also progress information of TeX
		compiler  will be shown.
	
	* The log file will be automatically read after compilation (|cgetfile|).
	
	* Debug mode is set by the value of |t:atp_DebugMode|, you can set or
	  see its value using |atp-:DebugMode| command (with completion for
	  debug modes).
							*t:atp_DebugMode*	
							*atp-debug-mode-silent*
							*'silent'*
	* if |t:atp_DebugMode| 	= 'silent'
	  :DebugMode silent
	  nmap <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>s
	       You will not get any message from compilation. 

							*atp-debug-mode-debug*
							*'debug'*
	* if |t:atp_DebugMode| 	= 'debug'
	  :DebugMode debug
	  nmap <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>d
	       After the end of compilation (invoked by the user or
	       autocommand) you will get a message with the return status of
	       the compilation. If the exit code is non zero it will be
	       highlighted with |hl-ErrorMsg|.

	       If you open the error window with |:copen| or with the menu
	       option ToggleDebugMode then it will be automatically closed
	       after first compilation with no errors. Quick fix window is
	       closed in both 'silent' and 'debug' debug modes. This depends
	       on |errorformat| which you can set with |atp-:ErrorFormat|
	       and |atp-:ShowErrors|:
		    ATP test for 'no errors' is 'len(|getqflist()|)'. If the
		    debug mode was 'debug' |t:atp_DebugMode| will fall back to
		    |g:atp_DefaultDebugMode| (by default it is the 'silent'
		    mode).

							*atp-debug-mode-Debug*
							*'Debug'*
	* if |t:atp_DebugMode| 	= 'Debug'
	  :DebugMode Debug
	  nmap <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>D
	       This mode is the same as 'debug' + after compilation ATP jumps
	       to first error.	

							*atp-debug-mode-verbose*
							*'verbose'*
							*b:atp_VerboseLatexInteractionMode*
	* if |t:atp_DebugMode| 	= 'verbose'
	       Every compilation which is invoked by the user will be run in
	       verbose mode (this mode is mapped to <F5> key).  In this mode
	       latex '-interaction=' switch is set from the variable
	       |b:atp_VerboseLatexInteractionMode| (the default value is
	       errorstopmode).

	Note: the 'verbose' mode in 'Vim' (in the console) needs to be run,
	when there is no other latex instance running. Now you get a message
	to wait until compilation ends. In future releases, a better solution
	will be worked out. Gui version 'gvim' works better (as it doesn't
	suspend the editor).

	The background compilation is always done in |g:atp_DefaultDebugMode|.
	Unless it is set to 'verbose' in which case 'debug' mode is used. 

	See also |atp-:copen|.

      							*g:atp_ProgressBar*
>
 g:atp_ProgressBar = 1  
<       By default, when using the python compiler you will get progress 
	message in your status line. The number indicates the last page number
	compiled by LaTeX. If by some reason, you want to switch this off, set
	g:atp_ProgressBar to 0 (use |let|).

	You need |g:atp_statusNotif|=1 and |g:atp_statusline|=1 for this
	feature to work (see also |laststatus| on how to activate status line
	in Vim).

	If there are many background processes the number which is shown
	belongs to the oldest process. (b:atp_ProgressBar is a dictionary
	{ 'pid' : 'pagenr' } - status line shows max of pagenr's).

	Note: the time between you start to compile and [1] appears in the
	status line is mostly the time when LaTeX is reading all the packages
	that you loaded in the preamble.
>
 b:atp_ProgressBar
<       This is a read only variable. It is equal to empty string '' if
	compilation is not going on, and while compilation it stores the page
	number which LaTeX is processing.

						    	*g:atp_DebugModeQuickFixHeight*
>
 g:atp_DebugModeQuickFixHeight = 8
<	This is the maximal height of |quickfix| window when opened by ATP.

	 						*atp-debug-mode-maps*
	 You can invoke compiler in the 'debug' mode with '|<LocalLeader>|d',
	 '|<LocalLeader>|D' for 'Debug' mode (jump to first error),
	 '|<LocalLeader>|l' uses the default mode.
	 						*g:atp_DefaultDebugMode*
>
 let g:atp_DefaultDebugMode = 'silent'
< 	This is the default debug mode in which background compilation will
	run. It can be set to 'debug', setting it to 'verbose' will have the
	same effect as setting it to 'debug'. ATP will come back to this debug
	mode if compilation ends with exit status 0.

	When compilations ends without errors (i.e. when quick fix list is
	empty for the current error format) |t:atp_DebugMode| falls back to
	|g:atp_DefaultDebugMode|.

							*g:atp_DebugCmdHeight*
							*g:atp_cmdheight*
>
 g:atp_DebugModeCmdHeight = &cmdheight
<       the default cmd height (see |cmdheight|) for the debug mode. 
	ATP will switch to it back and forth if needed. By default it is set
	to |cmdheigh| value (thus unless you set it to sth else you will not
	see the difference). 

	When going out of debug/Debug modes cmdheight is set to
	|g:atp_cmdheight| value (with default value set from 'cmdheight'
	option on startup). 

	Note: if you change |cmdheight| you should also change
	|g:atp_DefaultCmdHeight|, unfortunately vim has not autocommand group
	event to do that automatically.


:DebugMode [debug-mode]					*atp-:DebugMode*
	Command which help to set |t:atp_DebugMode| variable (has completion).
	[debug-mode] is one of "silent", "debug", "Debug", "verbose" (they can
	be suppressed to 's', 'd', 'D' or 'v' (or "si"/"sil"/"sile"/... etc).
	If no argument is given it shows the current debug mode.

	:DebugMode[!] silent
	(:DebugMode[!] s) 
	nmap <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>s
		It will load error file (|cgetfile|) with bang "!" it will
		open |quickfix| window if there are errors (|cwindow|). If
		|quickfix| window was opened it will be closed.
		Sets |t:atp_DebugMode|='silent'.
	:DebugMode debug	
	(:DebugMode[!] d) 
	nmap <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>d
		It will load error file (|cgetfile|) and open |quickfix|
		window with |:copen|.
		Sets |t:atp_DebugMode|='debug'
	:DebugMode Debug	
	(:DebugMode[!] D) 
	nmap <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>D
		It will load error file (|cgetfile|) and open |quickfix|
		window with |:copen|.
		Sets |t:atp_DebugMode|='Debug'
	:DebugMode verbose	
	(:DebugMode[!] v)
		Sets |t:atp_DebugMode|='verbose'

	The height of the |quickfix| window will be one more than the length
	of quick fix list (|getqflist()|) but nor more than
	|g:atp_DebugModeQuickFixHeight|.
							
:copen							*atp-:copen*
	Works slightly different than |:copen|. The [height] argument will not
	take efect. Use |:resize| instead. ATP computes the hiegth of the
	QuickFix window, and uses the variable |g:atp_DebugModeQuickFixHeight|
	as an upper bound for QuickFix window height.

							*b:atp_ReloadOnError*
The variable b:atp_ReloadOnError if set to 1 (which is the default) reload the
file even when the exit status of compiler was non zero. If set to 0, then the
file will not be reloaded [actually for viewers other than Xpdf it will not be
copied from the temporary directory, for Xpdf it will be copied but not
reloaded). 

There is also a variable which stores the last command which executed
your tex compiler, see |g:atp_TexCommand|.   

:{runs}TEX[!] [debug_mode]				*atp-:TEX*
map \l, map \d
	If anyway you want to run TeX yourself but you do not want to see the
	output this is the right tool. This runs TeX in 'nonstopmode'. You can
	specify an argument {runs} which tells how many consecutive runs of
	TeX you need (this is important if you want to compile Table of
	Contents, or index, or the bibliography (see |atp-:Bibtex|)

	Without "!" it copies the aux file only if there are no compilation
	errors, with "!" it updates the aux file even if there were errors.
	This is done to make the labels completion work better, when there are
	errors they often affect the aux file in a way that interferes with
	|atp-:Labels| command.

	If b:atp_OpenViewer=1 and there current viewer (b:Viewer) is not
	running on the output file then this function will open a viewer. By
	default b:atp_OpenViewer=0 and this feature is disabled. 

	The command :2TEX will call the compiler two times.

	It is useful when you want to make the outline (using hyperref
	package) of your article in pdf files, the tex file has to be
	'sourced' twice. To make the bibliography you can use |atp-:Bibtex|.

	If {runs} > 5 it will be reduced to 5, to avoid running tex for hundreds
	(or event thousands) of times (what could happen otherwise by
	a mistake giving the range of the command to be the current line
	number).

	The optional argument [debug_mode] has possible values: '', 'silent',
	'debug', 'Debug', 'verbose'. When '' the current debug mode is used
	(|t:atp_DebugMode|). ( [debug_mode] can be suppressed to 's', 'd',
	'D', 'v' or "si"/"sil"/"sile"/... etc.) See the description of
	|atp-debug-mode|.

	\d is mapped to :TEX debug and \l to :TEX (thus it uses your default
	debug mode).

:DTEX 							*atp-:DTEX*
map \d 
	This is equivalent to ':TEX debug'.

:MakeLatex[!]						*atp-:MakeLatex*
	With one command you can make your whole document: cross references,
	bibliography (with or without bibtex), index, table of contents, table
	of figures, table of theorems ([ntheorem package]), table of
	algorithms. ':MakeLatex!' should be used when an entry in the
	bibliography was deleted (when 'bibtex' is involved this is when you
	delete last citation command of a bib entry).

	If aux or log files are loaded in a buffer then they will be deleted
	- this is a requirement of vimgrep internal grep command (other wise
	vimgrep will search in the buffer not the hard disk version and they
	may differ). 

	Returns with error message if log contains '! Emergency stop.'

	If |g:atp_Compiler| = 'python' it uses the python script to compile
	document, if |g:atp_Compiler| = 'bash' it uses a bash command (UNIX
	only).

:Bibtex[!] [debug_mode]					*atp-:Bibtex*
map \b
    With BANG "!":
	This function will call bibtex to produce the bibliography file
	(.bbl). If in |b:atp_OutDir| there is no 'aux' file it first calls tex
	compiler. After the 'bbl' file is produced two consecutive runs of tex
	compiler are called to make the bibliography.

	If you specify any value to the [debug_mode] option (for the values
	see |atp-:TEX|) In verbose mode (only the last time tex compiler will
	run in errorstop mode and echoed to the console). This gives you the
	chance to see the output of bibtex command (it will be also printed
	when latex ends). 
	
	If bibtex returns with non zero exit code, latex will not be run
	afterwards. 
	
    Wihtout BANG "!"
	If you want to just run bibtex use :Bibtex without
	bang.

	The command :Bibtex  will :call Bibtex(), while :Bibtex v
	(and :Bibtex [debug_mode]) will :call Bibtex(1)

	The bang "!" is used in the same way as for |atp-:TEX| command.

	For the description of optional argument [debug_mode] see |atp-:TEX|.

							*g:atp_raw_bibinputs*
    Tex is looking for the date base files in the path: `kpsewhich -show-path
    bib`. The variable g:atp_bibinputs contains these directories separated by
    commas. If atp cannot find your bib file, tex also won't be able. 
							*g:atp_raw_texinputs*
    Similarly this variable stores all of path reported by `kpsewhich
    -show-path tex`.
							*g:atp_bibinputs*
    This is a list of directories as g:atp_raw_bibinputs with appended '**'
    see ':h file-searching'.
							*g:atp_texinputs*
    This is a list of directories as g:atp_raw_texinputs with appended '**'
    see ':h file-searching'.


							*atplib-:Kill*
:Kill							
	Kill python scripts running (b:atp_PythonPIDs) and all pids in
	|b:atp_LatexPIDs|. This only works with |g:atp_Compiler|="python".

:PID 							*atp-:PID*
	Prints PIDs of all running instances of |b:atp_TexComopiler|.


:Compiler {compiler-program}				*atp-:Compiler*
	Command which help to set |b:atp_TexCompiler| variable (with
	completion).

							*atp-:SetOutDir*
:SetOutDir					
	This is a command which sets the |b:atp_OutDir| variable and the
	|'errorfile'| option.  See |b:atp_OutDir| for the default value.

							*atp-:Latexmk*
:Latexmk[!]
	Compile with latexmk in background. 
	With bang "!": Force compilation with latexmk in background.

							*atp-:LatexmkClean*
:LatexmkClean[!]
	Clean temporary output from LaTeX. 
	With bang "!": Clean temporary output from LaTeX.

							*atp-:LatexmkStop*
:LatexmkStop
	Stop latexmk if it is running.

							*atp-:LatexmkStatus*
:LatexmkStatus[!]
	Show the running status of latexmk for the current buffer. 
	With bang "!": show the running status of latexmk for all buffers with
	process group ID's.

:ShowErrors [flag]					*atp-:ShowErrors*
nmap <LocalLeader>e					/for other maps see |atp-:ShowErrors-maps|/
	This command shows error/warning messages. It sets the |'errorformat'|
	variable accordingly to the optional [flag] argument, which is a word
	made of letters:
>
		e		- include errors
		w		- include all warning messages
		r		- include all reference warnings
		c		- include all citations warnings
		f		- include all font warnings
		fi		- include font info massages
		F		- show files listed in the log
				    (messages which start with 'File: ')
				    shows the files loaded by tex
					for example fd files that LaTeX is using
		p		- show packages loaded by tex 
				    (messages which start with 'Package: ')
		all		- show all above,
		All		- show All the log file,
		o		- open the log file in a new buffer (split).
<
	If none flag is given |g:atp_DefaultErrorFormat| value is used.  If
	'o' flag is used the split buffer with log message has a map 'q' to
	':bd'.  Example: >
		:ShowErrors rc
<	will show all reference and citation warnings.

	Note: this command works in quickfix window. It will change
	errorformat but will not reload quickfix list. Better use
	|atp-:ErrorFormat| instead.

							*g:atp_DefaultErrorFormat*
g:atp_DefaultErrorFormat = 'erc' 
    The value is the  same as argument to |atp-:ShowErrors| and
    |atp-:ErrorFormat|. This is the default argument for these commands when
    they are used without any argument. Also corresponding 'errorformat' is
    set up at startup.
						 
							*b:atp_ErrorFormat*
b:atp_ErrorFormat = 'ecw'
	This variable stores the current format of errors. It is a word with
	letters given in [flag] argument to |atp-:ShowErrors|. You can set it
	with |atp-:ErrorFormat| command. It is used by serveral ATP functions,
	for example call back feature checks if there are errors looking into
	Quick Fix list (with |getqflist()|), which will depend on the variable
	|b:atp_ErrorFormat|.
	    

ShowErrors maps:					*atp-:ShowErrors-maps* 

<LocalLeader>e		view errors with current |b:atp_ErrorFormat|	(:ShowErrors)
<F6>+e			to see all errors 			      (:ShowErrors e)
<F6>+w			to see all warnings			      (:ShowErrors w)
<F6>+r			to see warnings coming			      (:ShowErrors rc) 
			from references or citations  
<F6>+f			to see font warnings 			      (:ShowErrors f)

this is not a texloganalyzer mapping but it is a good place to mention it:
<F6>+l			to open log file in a new split window
			this is a mapping to the |atp-:OpenLog|.

:ErrorFormat {flag} 					*atp-:ErrorFormat*
	This command has the same syntax as |atp-:ShowErrors|. It sets the
	|b:atp_ErrorFormat| variable and vim option |'erroformat'|, and the
	rereads the log file with |cgetfile|. If {flag} is not given it only
	shows the current value of |b:atp_ErrorFormat|.  The variable
	|b:atp_ErrorFormat| is also set when you use the command
	|atp-:ShowErrors|.

	As an argument you mey use +{flag} and -{flag} then {flag} will be
	added/removed from |b:atp_ErrorFormat|, example: >
		:ErrorFormat +w
<	will add 'w' to |b:atp_ErrorFormat|.		
	Note: this command works in quickfix window.

							*atp-:SetErrorFile*
:SetErrorFile					
	If you change |b:atp_OutDir| variable and you want to update the
	|'errorfile'| option use this command. It will show you the value to
	which |'errorfile'| was set. 

:ShowErrors o						*atp-:OpenLog*
:OpenLog, map <F6>l, imap <F6>l
	Opens log file in a new split window with two options (which are set
	locally): 'ruler', 'nospell', and a map 'q' to ':bd'.	

	You can also use the command ':Explore' to see log, aux, ... files
	(which is a part of 'netrw' Vim plugin).


In the log file there are some special tools to syncronize the tex source file
and the Viewer (currently only Xpdf is supported) with log file:
|atp-:SyncTex| and |atp-:SyncXpdfLog|) These tools can sync tex file/Xpdf
automatically using autocommand group |CursorMoved|.

							*atp-:SyncTex-(log_file)*
:SyncTex[!]	(inside log file)
:nmap \g
	If you open log file with ':ShowErrors o' command then you can use
	this command to move to the place in the source code where the error
	occurs. It works with project files and also can go to error which
	appear in a declared package. It will go to the first error line
	declared in the log file below the cursor position (more precisely, to
	first line which matches '^l\.\d\+\|on input line\|at lines' will be used).

	With bang [!] it opens new window if the file with error is not shown
	in the current tab page. Without bang it opens the file in the window
	where ':ShowErrors o' was used.
							*g:atp_LogSync*
	If you set g:atp_SyncLog = 1 (the default value is 0) then the source
	file will be syncronize with the log file via autocommand (with
	|CursorMoved|). This sets 'cursorline' option to indicate the
	corresponding line in the source file. When the log buffer becomes
	hidden this option should be unset.
							*atp-:LogSync*
	To set g:atp_SyncLog you can use :Sync command. ':Sync' will toggle
	the value, ':Sync on' will set it to 1 and ':Sync off' will set it 
	to 0.

	If you set g:atp_developer = 1 this command will also go to files
	under texmf tree (packages and classes).

							*atp-:SyncXpdf*
							*g:atp_SyncXpdfLog*
:SyncXpdf
	If you set g:atp_SyncXpdfLog = 1 (the default value is 0) and you use
	Xpdf as a viewer it will be synchronised with the log file (with
	autocommand group |CursorMoved|). You can also use the command
	:SyncXpdf or :Xpdf in the log buffer which does the same.

:ViewOutput 						*atp-:ViewOutput*
map \v,map <F3>, imap <F3>  
	You would like to see what you are editing use this function. It will
	use the program defined in the variable b:atp_Viewer. See |b:atp_Viewer|,
	|g:atp_XpdfServer|, |atp-xpdfOptions|. When there is no output file it will run
	TeX and open the file. Read more about particular viewers
	(inverse/reverse searching) in |atp-viewers|. 

:SyncTex[!]						*atp-:SyncTex*
map t, map <S-LeftMouse>
	Which makes an forward search (vim->Viewer). As for now ATP supports Okular,
	Xpdf and Xdvi with this feature (Evince is not yet supported).

	Note: you can also set reverse search for Okular and Xdvi, see
	|atp-viewers-Okular| and |atp-viewers-Xdvi| for an instruction how to
	do that. Xpdf doesn't support reverse searching.

							*atp-:SyncTex_Xpdf-hack*
	Note: there is a bug in Xpdf, one canot sent commands to Xpdf to
	quickly. If the |atp-:SyncTex| command only updates the page, but
	doesn't shift it then you can try to set g:atp_XpdfSleepTime variable
	to something higher than the default 0.1 (this is sleep time between
	sending commands to Xpdf in seconds)

	When the output file or the synctex file (.synctex.gz) doesn't exists
	then first it will be generated. It can also open the document if it
	is not yet opened.

	Note: with bang |atp-:SyncTex| will not check if viewer is running.

	Read |atp-:SyncTex_with_Okular| if you use Okular.

:Viewer {viewer-program}				*atp-:Viewer*
    Command which help to set b:atp_Viewer variable (with nice completion).

:SetXdvi						*atp-:SetXdvi*
	This command sets the options for xdvi viewer, which enables inverse
	and reverse searching. You can use the command |atp-:SyncTex| for
	forward searches (Vim->Xdvi) >
		:SyncTex	(although dvi is using srcspecials rather than synctex)
		map t
		nmap <S-LeftMouse>
<	For inverse searching hold CTRL and click left mouse button on
	the text in xdvi viewer. It sets: >
	    let b:atp_TexOptions="-src-specials"
<	and also other variable to enable reverse searching (Xdvi->Vim) see
	more |atp-viewers-Xdvi|.

:SetXpdf						*atp-:SetXpdf*
:SetOkular						*atp-SetOkular*
	This command sets options for Xpdf viewer. Xpdf supports forward
	searching (vim->Xpdf) with command: |atp-:SyncTex|. It sets >
	    let b:atp_TexOptions="-synctex=1"
< 	Thus it enables the forward searching (the above is the default 
	value for ATP, but it will change when you use |atp-:SetXdvi| which
	uses "-src-specials".

	It reads the Xpdf viewer options from the variables
	|b:atp_xpdfOptions| and g:atp_xpdfOptions. Similarly for Okular.
						
:BibSearch /{pattern}/ [flag]				see |atp-:BibSearch|
	This function finds bib entries in bib files defined in your tex file
	and in the variable b:atp_BibFiles (see |b:atp_BibFiles|), which match the
	[pattern] (a Vim regular expression). The output is configurable by
	the [flag] argument, see |atp-bibflags|. By default the pattern is
	case insensitive.

  								*atp-:AMSRef*
:AMSRef[!] {bibdata}  
    A command to get bib data from AMSRef:
		    http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-mref 
    The bib data will be appended to bibliography of the current document. If
    there are many bib files will get a choice which one to use. This command
    is also available in bib files.  Without bang, i.e. "!", it writes and
    closes the bib buffer with it will leave you in unsaved bib file buffer.
    You will be also asked for the bib key, the default choice is to use the
    AMS bib key. 

    This command also works when you use \begin{bibliography} environment. But
    the default is to use a bib file.  The obtained bibliographic reference is
    copied to the register g:atp_bibrefRegister (the default is "0" so you can
    paste it using Vim command 'p'). In addition, it is stored in the variable
    g:atp_bibref.

:BibChoose						see |atp-:BibChoose|
map c, map y, map p
	This function is defined in the buffer with results of BibSearch
	command. It is mapped to 'y', 'c' and 'p' and let you copy the bib
	entry key to a register (see |atp-:BibChoose|) or directly to last
	opened buffer (after the last cursor position). When you choose to
	paste, it will close the BibSearch window.

:FindBibFiles						*atp-:FindBibFiles*
	This updates the variables s:bibfiles, s:allbibfiles,
	s:notreadablebibfiles. Finds all bib files defined in all
	'\bibliography' commands. For more about the above variables read
	|atp-variables-bib|. This function is called internally be the script
	functions BibSearch/BibChoose.  The command :FindBibFiles finds bib
	files in the current buffer. 

	If a readable bib file was not found under one of path listed in of
	g:atp_bibinputs variable (see |g:atp_bibinputs|) it is classified
	as not readable.  
							
:GotoFile[!]						*atp-:GotoFile*
:EditInputFile[!]	/ the old name / 		*atp-:EditInputFile*
nmap gf
	This command finds input files under b:atp_MainFile (it is recursive).
	The nmap 'gf' checks first if there is a file under the cursor. If
	there is no file under the cursor it list all input files. Input file
	is one introduced in the source file with \input{<file>}, \input
	<file> \include{<file>}. The current file is now shown with highlight
	group: |hl-WarningMsg|. 

	This command uses kpsewhich to find in which path to find input files.
	Actually the path variables: |g:atp_texinputs| for input files and
	|g:atp_bibinputs| for bib files are used.

	The bibliographic declared are also listed. The command searches for
	them in any directory listed in g:atp_bibinputs (see
	|g:atp_bibinputs|).

	If g:atp_developer = 1 (default 0) then the map 'gf' can also open
	package files and document class files, but only when using 'gf' over
	\usepackage or \documentclass tex commands.

	With bang "!" this command regenerates tree of files (this is
	important only in files with input lines), without it uses cached
	values (if they exist).

	The current file is now shown with highlight group: |hl-WarningMsg|. 

							*atp-:InputFiles*
:InputFiles				
	List input files of the current project. It also updates the
	|b:ListOfFiles| and |b:TreeOfFiles| variables to the current values.

	The variable *g:atp_inputfile_pattern* is used as a pattern to find
	input files. If you use 'biblatex' you do not need to put any pattern
	matching bibliographies (\addbibresource, \bibliography, ...), ATP has
	special way of dealing with them which is faster. If you use 'subfile'
	package ATP will add \\subfile pattern.

							*atp-:Open*
							*g:atp_LibraryPath*
:Open[!] [pattern] 
	If you configure g:atp_LibraryPath, this function will find files
	matching [pattern] under g:atp_LibraryPath and let them open with
	a program defined in >
		g:atp_OpenTypeDict
<	The g:atp_LibraryPath is a comma-separeted list of directory names.
	You should use wildcards '**' and '*' as in |globpath()|, if you want
	to include subdirectories, etc. For example >
	    let g:atp_LibraryPath=$HOME."/**"
<	will search for files under your $HOME directory. The default value of
	g:atp_OpenTypeDict is: >
	    let g:atp_OpenTypeDict = { 
		\ "pdf" 	: "xpdf",		"ps" 	: "evince",
		\ "djvu" 	: "djview",		"txt" 	: "split" ,
		\ "tex"		: "edit",		"dvi"	: "xdvi -s 5" }
<	The values of g:atp_OpenTypeDict should be a program to open the file,
	or one of 'tabe', 'split', 'edit', (if 'vim' is specified, then 'tabe'
	will be used). The cat program is also supported.

	Found files (all not just matching ones) are stored in the variable
	g:atp_Library. It is set by |globpath()| on g:atp_LibraryPath and then
	filtered, only files which extensions are given in g:atp_OpenTypeDict
	will be stored. This variable is restored by the global project script.
	You can use {bang} "!" to regenerate the library if it has changed.
	This is particularly useful as by default ATP remembers g:atp_Library in
	the common project script (see |atp-ProjectScript|).

:Delete[!]						*atp-:Delete*
map <F6>d
	Deletes all files which extension belongs to g:atp_tex_extensions in
	the directory |b:atp_OutDir|. By default |g:atp_tex_extensions| does
	not contain 'tex', 'pdf', 'dvi' so none of your important files will
	be deleted. When the command is used without bang the the extensions
	from |g:atp_DeleteWithBang| are removed from |g:atp_tex_extensions|.
	The defualt value of |g:atp_DeleteWithBang| contains for exemple
	'synctex.gz' extensions, thus it won't be removed by :Delete (without
	bang "!").
							*g:atp_delete_output*
	If you set |g:atp_delete_output|=1 the function will delete also the
	current output file (but not any other!) and 'synctex.gz' file.

							*g:atp_DeleteWithBang*
>
 g:atp_DeleteWithBang = ['synctex.gz', 'tex.project.vim']
<	This is list of extensions which will not be removed when
	|atp-:Delete| is run without bang. You do not need to add "pdf" or
	"dvi", extensions.

							*atp-:SshPrint*
:SshPrint [lpr_options]
	It will run 'lpr' command and append to it the options defined in the
	variable 'g:printeroptions' + options given in the second argument. It
	prints the pdf or dvi depending on the value of |b:atp_TexCompiler|.
							*g:atp_ssh*
	If you specify the variable 'g:atp_ssh=<user>@<host>' it will print
	via ssh on the <host> using the [lpr_options] passed to the lpr
	command. The command ':SshPrint' has a completion set for the printers
	available on your local system or in the host. You do not have to
	escape white spaces.
	
	The command has completion for the names of printers (also remote
	printers) and also other lpr options and its values, press <Tab> to
	cycle through printers, or type first letters of the printers name and
	press <Tab> to complete it.

							*atp-:Lpr*
:Lpr [lpr_options]					
	It prints using the lpr command on a local printer. The syntax and
	completion are the same as for |atp-:SshPrint|.

							*atp-:Lpstat*
:Lpstat
	Sends "lpstat -l" remotely (using the |g:atp_ssh| value) or locally and
	echoes the output.

							*atp-:ListPrinters*
:ListPrinters
	List printers available on the host |g:atp_ssh|.

							*atp-:WrapSelection*
:WrapSelection {beginWrapper} [endWrapper] [cursor_pos] [new_lines]

	Puts selected text between {beginWrapper} and [endWrapper]. Also sets
	the cursor position according to the [cursor_pos]. Possible values
	are: a number -- indicates the character offset from beginning of
	{beginWrapper}; or 'end' put the cursor at the end of [endWrapper] or
	'begin' leave the cursor at the beginning (to be precise at the end of
	the starting wrapper).  The default [endWrapper] is '}'.  The last
	argument [new_lines] 0/1 (default is 0): if 1 then the {beginWrapper}
	and [endWrapper] are put in separate lines (the begin line and end
	line are split), this is useful for putting text into and environment
	\begin{}:\end{}. 

	See |<f-args>| to know how to pass arguments. (They are separated with
	spaces, white spaces in arguments should be escaped with backslash
	'\'.)

	For the predefined maps which use WrapSelection see below
	|atp-maps-WrapSelection| or use |atp-:HelpVMaps|.

							*atp-:InteligentWrapSelection*
:InteligentWrapSelection {mathWrapperPair}, {textWrapperPair}, [cursor_pos], [new_lines]

	Puts the selected text inside {mathWrapperPair} if the cursor stands
	in mathematics otherwise inside {textWrapperPair}.  {mathWrapperPair}
	{textWrapperPair} are Vim lists of length at least 1, the first
	wrapper is the opening and the second is the closing one (if not given
	the default '}' is used. The other arguments are as for
	|atp-:WrapSelection|. If the opening leader in is not given then this
	command is not wrapping the text (see below for the suggested map
	'\tx').

	The command arguments should be separated with commas and quoted
	separately (see |<args>|).

	For the predefined maps which use |atp-:WrapSelection| see below
	|atp-maps-InteligentWrapSelection| or use |atp-:HelpVMaps|.

>
	    g:atp_font_encoding
<	stores the default encoding which is 'OT1', unless you use fontenc
	package, then the default for fontenc is used (the last defined in
	\usepackage[...]{fontenc} see the 'Latex2e font selection'
	/font user guide/ available on CTAN).

   	the highlighted text will put inside \textbf{ }. 

	You can also use a wrapper which was yanked into register 'a': >
		:WrapSelection @a
<  	This will work not only in visual mode. It will operate on last
	selected text. So if you accidentally lost the selection you can still
	use this command (but not the maps)!

							*atp-:TexAlign*
:TexAlign
map \a 
	This is a wrapper around Align command of the great AutoAlign Vim plugin:
	    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=884. 
	This command sets correct align options and aligns the environment.
	The following LaTeX environments are supported: >
	    equation, align, alignat, flalign, displaymath and tabular
<	Equation, align, alignat, flalign and displaymath are checked using
	syntax, tabular environment is checked using searchpair() function,
	the g:atp_completion_limits[2] applies.

    							*atp-:LatexTags*
							*atp-:Tags*
:Tags[!]
:LatexTags[!]
    Make a tag file with a python script included in ATP. It also scans aux
    file for associated numbers to labels which then are used as tags. If you
    declare hyperref package in the preambule also \hyperref{}{} commands are
    matched for tags as well. 
    |atp-:Tags| command will be defined only if you do not define it yourself. 

    Natbib as well as biblatex commands are supported (with exception of
    \cites, ... biblatex commands).

    With bang the bibtags for \cite commands are not made. If you use more
    than one bibliography file searching to which of them it belongs might
    take some time. If this is the case and you do not want this kind of tags
    you can make the tag file faster.

    Note: you might need to adjust 'iskeyword' Vim option. ATP is adding
    |g:atp_separator| to 'iskeyword' if |g:atp_no_separator| is 0.

    Note!:In Vim 'iskeyword' by default contains '_'. It is disabled by the
    stadard tex syntax file (you do not want to include _ from _{} LaTeX
    construct into 'w' motion). So it is better to avoid it in label names, so
    that |CTRL-]| works well. If you need to add it use:
	au FileType set iskeyword+=_
    (this will not work with setlocal).

    Note: the python script is sourced in the background. When the script
    finishes it will let you know. The tag file is not accessible until the
    script finishes.

    Check out |tag-and-searches| how to use tags.

    :LatexTags command is only defined if there was :Tags command defined.

:TOC[!] 							*atp-:TOC*
nmap \t
	Shows Table of Contents of your document. It do not yet support the
	starred version of chapter, section,... . 

	The optional argument bang controls if the table of contents data base
	must be generated: by default map \t doesn't regenerate the toc data
	base (unless if it doesn't exist), :TOC command regenerate the
	data base, :TOC! not.

	See |atp-toc-window| for commands and maps defined in the toc window.

	TOC() supports many edited files. For example if you have in your
	buffer list two files a.tex and b.tex this command will produce table
	of contents of both of them. If you have just one opened window
	(excluding the ToC window) then pressing <space>, <enter>, p and q
	will take you to the right buffer (which will be read if is unloaded
	or hidden). If you split a window then <space>, <enter>,
	p, q will take you to the window from which you are coming. However,
	if you have two windows with two different buffers loaded they will
	act on the window with the matching buffer name.

	The variable t:toc_window_width sets the width of table of contents
	window. By default t:toc_window_width=30. You can set a global
	variable g:toc_window_width to override the default value.

							*atp-:CTOC*
:CTOC	
	This function returns the name of the currently edited chapter/
	section/subsection/subsubsection. Use ':echo CTOC()' or just ':CTOC' to
	see the returned value. If you added a section unit the function will
	not update the database, run ':TOC' to do that (map \t).

:Labels[!]						*atp-:Labels*
map \L 
	Shows labels defined in your file. You can also use the commands and
	mappings described in |atp-toc-window|.

	If you forget what are these mappings, write ':map <buffer>' in the
	TOC or LABELS window, or move to the end of the LABELS window to see
	a short help message.

	The key 's' shows the context of the label under the cursor (your
	current window splits).

	The variable t:labels_window_width sets the width of labels window. By
	default t:labels_window_width=30. You can set a global
	variable g:labels_window_width to override the default value.

	Without bang "!" the labels data base will not be generated.
	Difference of \t and \L  is that \L regenerates the database (which is
	quite fast).

  							*atp-:GotoLabel*
:GotoLabel[!] {pattern} 
	The command does the obvious thing. The {pattern} matches against the
	label or label value (as appears in output file). When matching the
	label value '^' is added at the beginning of pattern. With bang it
	doesn't regenerate the labels dictionary. It works with project files.
	It has completion.  If pattern matches many labels they all are listed
	with some useful info: label value, label and the file where it was
	defined (only in projects). Examples: >
	    :GotoLabel 1.2
	    :GotoLabel ^thm:
<       Note: there is |atp-:Tags| command which makes the tag file, and you
	can use vim |tags| commands.

	Note: You can also use a tag file and vim |tags| commands, see
	|atp-:Tags|.

							*atp-:GotoNamedDest*
							{only in Xpdf}
:GotoNamedDest <destination_name>
	Using '\hypertarget{<destination_name>}{<text>}' from hyperref package
	you can insert into PDF named destinations. This command will set the
	position of PDF file in Xpdf to this destination. There is
	a completion for destination names. This command solely works with
	Xpdf. Using: >
	    :%s/\\label{\([^}]*\)}/\hypertarget{\1}{}/gc
<       you can turned labels into named destinations.


							*atp-:F*
:[count]F {arg}							
	Go (forward) to {arg}, {arg} might be: part, section, subsection,
	subsubsection, and defined environment. You can use command completion
	which uses all the locally defined environments.

							*atp-:B*
:[count]B {arg}
	Go (backward) to {arg}, like above |atp-:F|.


							*atp-:NEnv* *atp->e* *atp-<C-F>*
:NEnv {environment}
:[count]F {environment}
[count]map >e
[count]map <C-F>
	Move to next environment, for example ':NEnv definition'. Completion
	is set, which finds environments defined in current tex source file.
	This function omits environments in comment lines.

							*atp->m* *atp->M*
	{environment} can be also math or displayedmath. For convenience
	there are maps: }m and }M respectively.

	If g:atp_mapNn is set to one (see |atp-:ToggleNn|) then this command
	is using |atp-:S|.

							*atp-:PEnv* *atp-<e* *atp-<C-B>*
:PEnv {environment}
[count]:B {environment}
[count]map <e
[count]map <C-B>
	Move to previous environment, for example ':NEnv definition'. Completion
	is set, which finds environments defined in current tex source file.
	This function omits environments in comment lines.

							*atp-<m* *atp-<M*
	{environment} can be also math or displayedmath. For convenience
	there are maps: {m and {M respectively.

	If g:atp_mapNn is set to one (see |atp-:ToggleNn|) then this command
	is using |atp-:S|.

							*atp-:NextSection*

[count]:F {section}
 map >p,  map >c,  map >s,  map >S
vmap >p, vmap >c, vmap >s, vmap >S

	Go to next part/chapter/section/subsection/subsubsection which title
	matches optionally given [title_pattern]. With bang "!" the command
	doesn't skip commented sections. Maps skip them. The search will wrap
	around the end of a file if 'wrapscan' is set.

	The {section} argument for :F is one off:
	    part/chapter/section/subsection/subsubsection.

	Map  		Command			Meaning
	>p		:NPart			go to next part
	>c		:NChap			go to next chapter
	>s		:NSec			go to next section	
	>S		:NSSec			go to next subsection

							*g:atp_map_forward_motion_leader*
	You can set the leader '>' using |g:atp_map_forward_motion_leader|
	variable.

	Note: If you leave the default value of |g:atp_forward_motion_leader|
	then ATP remaps |>>| to >> and also |v_>| to >>. |>| is working and is
	not touched by ATP. If you have |'timeout'| set then the map is
	executed faster, if you use |'notimeout'| this workaround it makes
	these operators work.

	Note: If you set |g:atp_forward_motion_leader|="}" then ATP remaps |}|
	operator to }}

	Note: the maps work in visual mode and operator pending mode ('d\ns'
	will delete till the end of the section). You can use |n| and |N| Vim
	normal commands (also in visual mode) to go further. 

	In visual mode these maps go to end of current section or, if already
	at the end of section, end of next section. 

	[title_pattern] is the pattern which will match for the pattern, it
	should start with '.*' when you want to match somewhere in a middle of
	the title. 
	
	These commands (and maps) use Vim |search()| function or |atp-:S| command
	depending on the value of |g:atp_mapNn| (see |atp-:ToggleNn|, when
	g:atp_mapNn=1 the |atp-:S| command is used). You can set the value
	of |g:atp_mapNn| using the command |atp-:ToggleNn|. If 'wrapscan' is
	set and g:atp_mapNn=1 the search will wrap around the end of the project (not the end of
	the current buffer).

	You can unmap these keys and use <Plug>GotoNextSubSection,
	<Plug>GotoNextSection, <Plug>GotoNextChapter, <Plug>GotoNextPart to
	define new maps.

	the command doesn't skip commented sections. Maps skip them. The
	search will wrap around the beginning of a file if 'wrapscan' is set.

						*g:atp_map_backward_motion_leader*
	You can set the leader '<' using |g:atp_map_bacward_motion_leader|

	These commands (and maps) use Vim |search()| function or |atp-:S|
	command depending on the value of |g:atp_mapNn| (see |atp-:ToggleNn|,
	when g:atp_mapNn=1 the |atp-:S| command is used). If 'wrapscan' is
	set and g:atp_mapNn=1 the search will wrap around the beginning of
	the project (not the beginning of the current buffer).

	You can unmap these keys and use <Plug>GotoPreviousSubSection,
	<Plug>GotoPreviousSection, <Plug>GotoPreviousChapter,
	<Plug>GotoPreviousPart to define new maps.


	Note: If you leave the default value of |g:atp_forward_motion_leader|
	then ATP remaps |<<| to << and also |v_<| to <<. |<| is working and is
	not touched by ATP. If you have |'timeout'| set then the map is
	executed faster, if you use |'notimeout'| this workaround it makes
	these operators work.

	Note: If you set |g:atp_forward_motion_leader|="{" then ATP remaps |}|
	operator to {{


Previous commands where using relative position - goto next/previous
section/chapter. The following commands/maps will go to section/chapter as
counted from first one.
							*atp-:SSec* *atp--S*
							*atp-:Sec*  *atp--s*
							*atp-:Chap* *atp--c*
							*atp-:Part* *atp--p*
:[count]SSec
nmap -S
:[count]Sec
nmap -s
:[count]Chap
nmap -c
:[count]Part
nmap -p
	Go to subsection/section/chapter/part [count] from begin of the
	section/chapter/document, i.e. 3]s will jump to section 3 in current
	chapter. Mark ' is preserved.

	Note: if you are in a section which has no subsections :SSec and -S
	will go to next section, the same aplies to other section types.

	You can set the leader for maps with *g:atp_goto_section_leader* .


    							*atp-:SkipCommentForward*
							*atp-]star* *atp-gc*
:SkipCommentForward 
nmap ]* gc
	Go to end of current/next comment group.
    							*atp-:SkipCommentBackward*
							*atp-[star* *atp-gC*
:SkipCommentBackward 
nmap [* gC
	Go to begining of current/previous comment group

							*atp-:ToggleStar*
:ToggleStar 	 	 
map |<LocalLeader>|s	  
	Add/removs a star from the current environment (if it is not one
	belonging to the list: >
		    g:atp_no_star_environments
<	See |b:atp_StarEnvDefault| and |b:atp_StarMathEnvDefault|.

							*atp-:ToggleEnv*
:ToggleEnv	 	
map <S-F4>    		
	mapped to <F4> and <S-F4>, switches environment        	name. See
	(i.e. echo ) g:atp_toggle_environments_1...7 (you can change or add
	your own variables, just add numbers - they must be consecutive).          	
	
	Read |g:atp_toggle_labels| below how it handles the prefixes of
	labels.

							*atp-:ChangeEnv*
:ChangeEnv		
nmap <F4>
	This does the same as the above command but asks for environment name

	Read |g:atp_toggle_labels| below how it handles the prefixes of
	labels.

							*g:atp_toggle_labels*
	The commands |atp-:ToggleEnv| and |atp-:ChangeEnv| changes the
	prefixes of labels (if there is one, which belongs to
	g:atp_shortnames_dict) and all ref's (\ref, \eqref and \pageref).  You
	have to turn on this feature by putting g:atp_toggle_labels=1 (by
	default it is 0).  Check if it works for you!  If there is a label or
	reference to which it wants to change it doesn't change labels and
	issue a Warning Message, thus I believe it should work for every one,
	but as this changes your file it is turned off by default.) 

	In project files this is done in all files belonging to the project.
	Changes are not saved by default (ATP uses |'hidden'| option, so when
	you use q! or qa! all changes will be lost).

							*atp-:WrapEnvironment*
:WrapEnvironment {environment} 
vmap <F4>		
	Mark part of the text and wrap it into anvironment given as the
	argument, the map will let you choose the environment name.

							*atp-:Wdiff*
:Wdiff {old-file} {new-file}
	This is diff using the GNU wdiff. This command will split the view and
	show the wdiff output. You can use ]s and [s to go to next previous
	change. The deleted parts of {old-file} are marked embraced into
	{=...=} and highlighted with |hl-DiffDelete|. The added parts of
	{new-file} are embraced with {+...+} and highlighted with
	|hl-DiffAdd|. If the preambles differ you will be asked which one to
	use in the diff file.

	This is an alternative for latexdiff program, but is much faster.

	The diff file might not compile well (thus the b:atp_autex is set to
	0 by default), this is mainly because the math environments can be
	break and the output might contain: \( a {= =c\)=} {+ !=c\)+} Other
	things which are not taken into account are changes of environment
	names, changes of coordinates in tikz. It would be nice to tell to
	wdiff to not diff them, but this is not implemented.

	After you resolve such conflicts the file should compile nicely
	(though I didn't do many tests). After that you can change {=...=} and
	{+...+} for something better. For example you can change {= and =} for
	\textcolor{red}{=} and {+, +} for \textcolor{blue}{+}. If you resolved
	syntactic conflicts in a very nice way you can change whole {=<old>=}
	for \textcolor{red}{<old>} and {+<new>+} for \textcolor{blue}{<new>}.
	For this you can use the following Vim command:

							*atp-:NiceDiff*
:NiceDiff
	(which also remaps ]s and [s and keeps the highlighted areas).
	The :NiceDiff command, although I tried, is not changing all the regions,
	I will try to fix this in next releases. (Thus not all parts of the output
	file might be highlighted).

							*atp-:Dsearch*
:Dsearch[!] [/]{pattern}[/] 					
	The {pattern} argument is optional. It is any vim pattern. Finds all
	definitions which matches the pattern. It looks in the main file (only
	in the preamble, unless the optional bang '!' is used) and all the
	input files (except bib files). This command respects the options:
	'ignorecase' and 'smartcase'. You can override them with '\C' (match
	case what follows) and '\c' (ignore case in what follows).

	It works likes ]d but handles multi line definitions.

*g:atp_DsearchMaxWindowHeight* = 15
	You can set the maximal hieght of the window wich shows the results of
	|atp-:Dsearch| (default is 15).

							*atp-:FontSearch*
:FontSearch[!] [pattern]				
	For example:
	:FontSearch ^t1
		will list all the fd files in your tex distribution which
		names starts with t1 (i.e. which describes fonts in encoding
		'T1')
	:FontSearch! bookman
		will list all fd files which full path matches 'bookman'.

	In the opened window there are several mappings defined:
	    <Enter>   	open the fd file under the cursor
	    <Tab>	list fonts defined in the fd file (shows the command
			that you can use in your tex file to use this font)
	    p		preview the fonts defined in the fd file under the
			cursor, do not shows the latex source. 	
	    P		preview fonts and show the latex source 
			(then you can see the errors why the preview was not
			produced; in many cases there are no encoding files or
			fonts themselves for which you have to look in CTAN
			archive yourself; or YOU CAN just SEE HOW TO USE 
			FONTS :) )
	    q 		close the window (actually, delete the buffer using
		       :bd, it will be still in the list if you type ":ls!",
		       so even then you can reload previous searches.)  

	In addition to 'p' and 'P' maps there is a :Preview command. 
	Note: the maps 'p' and 'P' work in both normal and visual mode.
	You can select a part of the text and use this maps or the command
	:Preview to make one preview file for all the font files.


	The same mappings are defined in the window with fd file opened
	(except <Enter>, <Tab>).  

	Additionally, read |font-lowlevelcommands| to learn how to use
	|\usefont|, |\fontsize|, |\selectfont| and other such commands.
	The 'Latex 2e font selection' by 'LeTeX3 Project Team' might be very
	useful. It is available on the net (you probably have it in your tex
	distribution if it is installed with the documentation, if not check
	the CTAN archive).

	ATP also has a very nice completion for various font declaration
	commands, see |atp-completion-fontdeclaration|.

	Hopefully, this will help your documents to become beautiful :)

							*atp-:FontPreview*
:FontPreview[!] {fdFile} [encoding] [keep_tex]
	Previews all fonts defined in fd file matching the pattern <fd_file>
	with encoding [encoding] (optional). If [keep_tex] is 1 (default is 0)
	it will keep the latex source file for debugging purposes.

	Without [!] it matches just the name of the fd files, with [!] the
	pattern {fdFile} matches for full path.

	It returns a list of fonts which fd files matches the {fdFile} pattern in
	[encoding]. You will be asked to chose for which files make a preview,
	possible answers are: >
			1,2,3
< 	which is equivalent to >
			1-3
<	you can also mix this notation: >
			1,2-5,7	
<	As in FontSearch command the [keep_tex] variable specifies if
	the source file will be shown (for debugging purposes, or just to look how
	to use the font :).


							*atp-status-line*
:Status[!]						*atp-:Status*
(:ATPStatus[!])						*atp-:ATPStatus*
	This comman sets the status line, which include: the name of currently
	edited chapter (or section) the value of |b:atp_OutDir| (unless used
	with bang!) and it will warn you if |b:atp_OutDir| variable is not
	set. The status line will also contain the information about
	processing compelation: see |atp-status-line-notification|,
	|g:atp_ProgressBar|. This function is called at startup unless the
	variable '|g:atp_statusline|=0' is set. The status is set by the
	autocommand: >
		au BufWinEnter *.tex :call Status()
<	In this way every opened window with a '*.tex' file will get the correct
	status line.

	If there was a command with name 'Status', atp is not overwriting it,
	it uses ATPStatus name.

							*g:atp_statusOutDir*
	Note: if you set g:atp_statusOutDir=0 (the default is 1) then the
	output directory will be not seen in the statusline.

ToDo({keyword}, {stop}, [bufname])		*atp-function-ToDo*
:ToDo [bufname]					*atp-:ToDo*
:Note [bufname]					*atp-:Note*
	The function list all the lines of the buffer [bufname] which match
	for the pattern '%.*{keyword}'. The {stop} argument is the pattern to
	before which to stop. The optional argument is the buffer name
	(the buffer name completion is set on). If not given the current
	buffer is assumed.  You can set highlighting for this command by:
		highlight atp-Todo ctermfg=... 	guifg=...
	The command :ToDo sets keyword='\c\<todo\>' and
	stop='\s*%.*\c\<note\>', and the command :Note sets
	keyword='\c\<note\>' and stop='\s*%.*\c\<todo\>'. This prevent from
	listing ToDo lines with Notes and vice versa. 

  							*atp-:WordCount*
:WordCount[!] 					
	The command to compute the number of words. With bang [!] it will show
	the word count of each input file. It uses 'detex' program (which is
	present in 'texlive') to remove the latex markups prior to word
	counting (done by the external 'wc' program).  Note: This command will
	first save the file. 

							*atp-:Babel*
:Babel
	If g:atp_babel variable is set on start up to 1 (however, the default
	value is 0, you can use |vimrc| or |atprc| file to switch it on) then
	ATP will set the |'keymap'| option according to the default babel
	language (which is the last language passed to babel as optional
	argument [lang_list] in \usepackage[lang_list]{babel}). 
  
	If g:atp_babel is set to 1 the keymap name is shown in the status
	line (if you use the |atp-status-line|.
							*g:atp_keymaps*
	The |g:atp_kemaps| variable is used to translate babel language name
	to 'keymap' value. The default is something like: >
    let g:atp_keymaps = { 
		\ 'british'	: 'ignore',		'english' 	: 'ignore',
		\ 'USenglish'	: 'ignore', 		'UKenglish'	: 'ignore',
		\ 'american'	: 'ignore',
	    	\ 'bulgarian' 	: 'bulgarian-bds', 	'croatian' 	: 'croatian',
		\ 'czech'	: 'czech',		'greek'		: 'greek',
		\ 'plutonikogreek': 'greek',		'hebrew'	: 'hebrew',
		\ 'russian' 	: 'russian-jcuken',	'serbian' 	: 'serbian',
		\ 'slovak' 	: 'slovak', 		'ukrainian' 	: 'ukrainian-jcuken',
		\ 'polish' 	: 'polish-slash' }
<	When the value is <ignore> then the function <SID>Babel() (or the
	command |atp-:Babel|) will ignore setting keymap option for this
	language. Using the above syntax you can set this variable in |vimrc|
	or |atprc| file.

	This is useful if you in day to day work use one language, but some
	times you write a tex file in some other language.

							*atp-:ShowOptions* 
:ShowOptions[!] [pattern]
	This will show values of variables that are currently set. 
	With bang it also shows global variables defined in
	'ftplugin/ATP_files/options.vim' (that means almost all global
	variables). Completion lists are filtered out by default. 

	The optional argument [pattern] is used to filter variables names with
	the given pattern.

	TIP: if you are looking for a variable you can use this command to
	find it.

							*atp-:HelpEnvIMaps*
							*atp-:HelpMathIMaps*
							*atp-:HelpVMaps*	
:HelpEnvIMaps
:HelpMathIMaps
:HelpVMaps
	These commands list valid mappings defined by ATP (unless g:no_plugin_maps or
	g:no_atp_maps are defined).

 							*atp-:ShowPackages*
:ShowPackages	lists LaTeX packages defined in the preamble.
							*atp-:Preamble*
:Preamble	echoes the preamble to vim pager.							

  							*atp-:ReloadATP*
:ReloadATP 
    Reloads ATP plugin: variables, functions, and maps. Note that maps are not
    deleted.

================================================================================
TABLE OF CONTENTS WINDOW					 *atp-toc-window*

	For the table of contents command and maps read |atp-:TOC|.

	The Table of Contents window is used by both |atp-:TOC| and |atp-:Labels|
	commands.

	In the Table of Contents window there are the following nmaps:

	    'e' 	to echo the line from your tex file
	    'y' or 'c' 	to yank the label of the chapter under the cursor
			    to a register, if it exists,
	    'p' 	to paste it directly to your tex file (just after the
			    current cursor position), 
	    's'		it splits the window with your tex source file and
			    sets the current line to the beginning of the
			    chapter/section under the cursor,
	    'q' 	to quit, and finally, 
	    <Enter> 	to go to the chapter under the cursor and close ToC.
	    <space> 	to go to the chapter under the cursor but leave ToC
			    open.

	There are also commands: ':C' and ':P', which do the same as 'c' and
	'p' mappings. They all call the function 'Yank(<where>)', the argument
	<where> can be one of: '@<register name>' or 'p'. 

	You can also delete and paste sections using the Table of Contents
	window:
							*atp-:YankSection*
							*atp-:DeleteSection*
							*atp-:PasteSection*
							*atp-:SectionStack*

	These commands are available in table of contents. They act on
	parts/chapters/sections/subsections/subsubsections.
>
    :YankSection [register]
<	Yank the section under the cursor (in table of contents) to the given
	register. If the register is not specified use the unnamed register
	(|registers|).
	 
	 The other commands do not use registers but an internal stack.
>
    :DeleteSection
    :PasteSection
    :SectionStack
<	Using ':DeleteSection' you can delete the section under cursor together 
	with all its subsections.  /Section can be one of: part, chapter,
	section, subsection, subsubsection, or bibliography/.  Deleted section
	will be added to a stack which can be shown using the command
	':SectionStack' There is a command to paste the section from section
	stack ':PasteSection'. By default it pastes the most recent element in
	the stack. Passing a number will paste that element of the stack
	/bear in mind that then numbers of sections in the stack will change/.

	':PasteSection' puts the section just after where current section
	ends (section under the cursor in the ToC buffer).

	Note: If you use bibtex commands to make bibliography ATP finds the
	line which contains '\bibliography' command. And then searches
	backward for the first line which is a blank line. The next line is
	assumed to be the first line of bibliography.  Thus to move the last
	section before bibliography or the bibliography itself its better you
	put a blank line before bibliography commands.  The same applies for
	bibliographies put in the middle of document (end of a chapter, part,
	etc.) The end of bibliography is found in the same way as the end of
	subsubsection.  If you use
	\begin{thebibliography}:\end{thebibliography} there is no such
	a problem.

	If you want to paste a section before the first section, use the line
	with the file name. 
							*atp-:Undo*
>
 :Undo 
 nnoremap u, nnoremap U, nnoremap g-, nnoremap g+ 
<	You can use undo. The :Undo command will undo in the buffer under
	the cursor (it switches to the correct window, using the Vim undo
	function, and runs :TOC command - so after all your back in ToC.). The
	':Undo' command has one argument - the Vim undo command to use, it is
	one of: 'u/U/g-/g+' (the default is 'u'). They are mapped to 'u','U',
	'g-' and 'g+'.  (only in the ToC buffer).  Note: ':Undo' command
	doesn't changes the Section Stack.

	There is one more level of security: There is a global variable which
	stores all the deleted sections together with some information about
	them: >
			g:atp_SectionBackup
<	it is a Vim list (see |List|). Each entry is a list of the following format: >
		[ <title>, <type>, <deleted_section>, <section_nr>, <file> ]
<	where <title> is the section title, <type> is one of: part, chapter, 
	section, subsection, subsubsection bibliography or abstract.  Deleted
	section is a list of deleted lines, <section_nr> is the number of the
	section that it had before delete, <file> is the full path to the
	file which it comes from.  If you need to use it, you can use the Vim
	function |append()| to put the <deleted_section> in the right place.

	NOTE:
		You may want to have a map: >
				:au FileType toc_atp nnoremap dd :DeleteSection<CR>
<		this can be put in your '$HOME/.atp.vim' configuration file.

SEARCHING IN BIB FILES 		                       		 *atp-bibsearch*

		}							/	

			article 		<-- bib field keyword 
			author,title,...	<-- bib entry label 	
			<label>			<-- bib field label 	


One more function is provided which searches the bib files for bib fields, 
and for the bib field labels for the latex command \cite{}.

:BibSearch /{pattern}/ [flag] 					*atp-:BibSearch*
	which do what you expect. The arguments should not be quoted and
	separated by a white spaces (if you want to include a white space use
	'\ '), for more see |f-args|. If you do not provide any argument then
	all entries of all bib files will be shown. 
								*g:atp_bibsearch*
	Note: {pattern} should be a python regular expression not vim regular
	exression. Unless you set |g:atp_bibsearch|="vim" (the default is
	"python"). Python regular expressions are quite similar to vim with
	'nomagic' set ( grouping with '(' and ')', with separating
	alternatives with '|'). But there is no vim '\&' in python regexp.

	The pattern to highlight matching string is passed to |@/| hence you can
	use |n| and |N| in the BibSearch buffer. This will only work for
	{pattern} which is both vim and python regular expression.

	See |atp-bibflags| for the [flag] argument.

								*atp-bibpatterns*
	Note: Upper pattern is vim pattern lower one is python regexp. 

	Before the match all the ligature symbols and {:} are removed. For
	example \`a, \' e, \oa,\ea are substituted with a, e, oa, ea
	(respectively).  Note that the space in \' e is also removed. Each
	line (without ligatures) of every bib file found in your tex document
	will be matched against the pattern, for example if the pattern is:
>
 		'author.*Grothendieck'
 		'author.*Grothendieck'
<
	the BibSearch function will find all the bibliographic fields
	which in one line have the words 'author' and 'Grothendieck' (in most
	cases it means that you will see only works of Grothendieck). Another
	example:
>
		'^\(\s*author.*Joayl\)\|Galois Theory'
		'^(\s*author.*Joayl)|Galois Theory'
<
	will result in all bib fields which author is Joyal or 
	which includes the words 'Galois Theory' (which by the way appear in
	many article/book titles), yet another example:	
>
		'author.*Joayl\|title.*Galois Theory'
		'author.*Joayl|title.*Galois Theory'
<
	This will match against all bib entries written by Joyal or which title
	includes the word 'Galois Theory'.
>
 		'author.*Joyal\&.*Tirney'
		 ! python has no '\&' !
<	
	will find all the bib entries which were written by Joyal and Tirney
	(and maybe somebody else). 

	For now, there is no possibility to filter bibliographic entries which
	both match a pattern in separate lines, i.g. to show all bib entries
	written by Joyal on 'Descent Theory'.

	Before a match, all '{', and '}' are deleted from the line of the bib file.
	But you will see them in the output (what can be useful for debugging
	errors in bib files)

	Note that in Vim patterns should be quoted using '...' not "...".   

	Further examples are supplied after the next section
	|atp-bibflags:examples|, which describes other functionalities of the
	BibSearch/BibChoose commands.

								*atp-bibpattern:last*
								*atp-bib-b:atp_LastBibPattern*
	The variable 'b:atp_LastBibPattern' stores the last pattern used by
	bib search.

								*atp-bibflags*
	The optional argument [flags] chooses what and in which order you want
	to see the  bib entries found (entries are listed in the order they
	appear in bib file).  Flag is a word made of letters.  There are three
	kinds of flags: entry flags which matches against labels of bib
	entries, like author, title, etc..., and keyword flags: which matches
	against keywords of bib fields: @article, @book, @techreport, etc...
	and two special flags 'All' and 'L'. A flag is a word on letters:
>
		a  - author
 		e  - editor
 		t  - title
 		b  - booktitle
 		j  - journal
 		s  - series
 		y  - year
 		n  - number
 		v  - volume
 		p  - pages
 		P  - Publisher
 		N  - Note
 		S  - School
 		h  - howpublished
 		o  - organization
		u  - url	
		H  - Homepage	
  any other letter - do not show anything but the first line of bib entry 
		@a - article 						/@article/
		@b - book or booklet 					/@book,@booklet/
		@B - Booklet 						/@booklet/	
		@c - incollection 					/@incollection,@inbook/
		@p - proceedings, inproceedings, conference   		/@proceedings,@inproceedings,@conference/
		@m - misc 						/@misc/
		@M - Manual 						/@manual/
		@t - master or PhD thesis  				/@masterthesis,@phdthesis/
		@T - Techreport 					/@techreport/
		@u - unpublished  					/@unpublished/		
		All - all flags						(see |atp-bibflags:all|)		
		L   - last flags					(see |atp-bibflags:last|)		
<
	Examples:
>
		tayu@a		--> show the entries: tile, author, year, url of matching articles.
		baeP@b		--> show the entries: booktitle, author, editor, 
 							publisher of matching books (@book,@booklet).
<
	Flags '@.' are filtered out, if one does not belong to the one above
	then it is deleted. You can see which flags are defined using
	ShowOptions function/command (they are listed as Available
	KeyWordFlags).
								*atp-bibflags:default*
	The default flag is stored in the global variable g:defaultbibflags and is
	equal to 'tabejsyu'. This means that the output for each bib field found 
	will include the 
		title
		author
		booktitle
		editor
		journal 
		series
		year
	if title,author,... are specified in the bibliography for the given
	position. If there are many position which match you can set flags to
	be as simple as possible to include more lines on the screen. For
	example 'tabe' is quite reasonable (note that all bib entries are
	matched separately, i.e. if a bib field has both 'title' and 'booktitle'
	bib entries it will give you both of them.

								*atp-bibsearch-show-only-keys*
	If you just want to list just the lines with bib fields keywords:
	@article{, @book{, etc. supply a flag which do not belongs to
	'g:defaultallbibflags', for example 'X', or 'X@a'
	
								*atp-bibflags:+*
	You can also specify flags with '+', for example: 
>
	flags='+p'
	flags='+@b'
<
	This feature ADDS FLAGS TO THE DEFAULT VALUE defined in the variable
	g:defaultbibflags (see |atp-defaulbibflags|). The first will result in
	showing the default entries and the page number, the second will
	result in showing only books with the default bib entries. You can
	specify as many additional flags as you wish.  *atp-bibflags:output*
	Note that the function shows the line with database file name if there
	are entries in this bibliography which match the pattern thus,for
	example, if you specify the flag '@a' and you see the line with
	database file name, but you do not see any bib entry, then in this
	database there are bib fields which match but these are not articles.
	
								*atp-bibflags:all*
	The flags='All' is a synonym of flag=g:defaultallbibflags which by default is
	equal to'tabejfsvnyPNSohiuHcp' i.e. all flags in this order. If you
	add your own flag you should change this global variable. You can add to
	this flag any flag which contains '@' (see |atp-bibflags|) by
	the plus operator, i.e. All+@a@b or +@aAll will give the same result.

								*atp-bibflags:last*
								*atp-bib-b:atp_LastBibFlags*	
	The variable 'b:atp_LastBibFlags' stores the recently used flags. The flag
	'L' sets the flags for this search to the value of 'b:atp_LastBibFlags'.
	You can write '+L@a', '+L@a', 'L@a' or '@aL' but not '+@La', if you
	want to add some flags to previous searches. Next time the flag 'L'
	will change the meaning (i.e. it is really the last time not earlier
	:) However, there is no '-' :( '-@aL' could be helpful.
	 
	The variable 'b:atp_LastBibFlags' is not changed when you use the 'All'
	flag.

								*atp-bibflags:add-flag*
	You can add your own flags but not keyword flags (i.e. @a,@b,...).
	Just add an entry to the dictionary g:bibflagsdict. (:ShowOptions v to
	see its current value), For example
>
	let g:bibflagsdict=extend(g:bibflagsdict, 
	\ { '<flags_name>' : [ '<bib_entry_name>': '<how_to_show>'] })
< 
	where, <flags_name> is the flag to use (it should be one letter), it
	must be different from the defined flags, <bib_entry_name> is a
	lower case bib entry name, like 'title', 'url', etc., <how_to_show> if
	you want to have a nice output put the bib entry name and that much of
	white spaces to get 13 strings.

	Some examples:						*atp-bibflags:examples*
>
	    :BibSearch 
<				Above command shows all bib fields with
				the default flags (might be slow, why not to
				open bib file with :GotoFile)
>
	    :BibSearch @ yt	
<				and this is a tip how to show all bib fields with
				different flags than the default ones(the '@'
				will match at every bib field!). It is
				equivalent to:
>
	    :BibSearch // yt

	    :BibSearch /title[\s.]*Galois Theory/  aetb
<
	The next one shows all bib fields which were written by Joyal and
	Tirney (and may by somebody else).
>
	    :BibSearch author.*Joyal\&.*Tirney
< 	This is not possible with |g:atp_bibsearch|="python" (the default).

		
:BibChoose {BibEntry[RegisterName]}					*atp-:BibChoose*
map c, map y, map p
	This function/command is only available in the window with BibSearch results
	and allows to copy a bib entry key to a register or directly to the
	last opened buffer (after the cursor position). It is mapped to 'c'
	and 'y'. You will be asked to give the number of bib entry to yank:
>
	    <bib entry number><register name><Enter>	- to copy it to a register
	    <bib entry number><Enter>			- to paste it to 'tex' file
	    <Enter>					- to skip the choice
<	
	When you paste the bib entry key the bib search window will close. For
	example: >
		:BibChoose 5e
		:BibChoose 7+
		:BibChoose 2
<	Copy the bibkey to register e,+ or paste directly to the buffer 
	in which :BibSearch was invoked, at last cursor position.	

	The same you will obtain using the nmaps y or c. 
	
	This commands and maps are only in the BibSearch buffer.

								*atp-bibsearch-highlight*
	The colours of the output are set by the syntax file
	'syntax/bibsearch_atp.Vim'. All groups except one are the same as in
	the syntax file for bib files ('syntax/bib.Vim' in your $VIMRUNTIME
	directory). Their names are 'bibsearchEntryKw' instead 'bibEntryKw'.
	The one that is differently defined 'bibsearchComment'.  Which is
	changed in that way to highlight the bib file names.  One additional
	highlight group is: 'bibsearchInfo'. It highlights the number of
	entry and its line number in the bib file. By default all bibsearch
	groups are linked to the corresponding bib group, the bibsearchInfo
	group is not set.
	
	In a colour file (~/.Vim/color/*.Vim) you can use these groups to set
	colours.  See |highlight| or just read a colour file. For example,
	this is a nice set of colours for dark background 
		
							 	
								
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BIBSEARCH COMMENTS					*atp-bibsearch-comments*	
					
	Please do not hesitate to report any bug to the mailing list
	|atp-mailing-list|.
	
	The algorithm will work only if all kind of bib entries of your bib
	file are included in the list g:bibentries. However, changing just
	this variable is not enough. In that case the search engine (function
	s:search) will produce correct output, but the function which displays
	found entries, will not know how to work with the new entries. One
	would have to add an entry to the dictionary 'g:bibflagsdict'. If
	it is the case, please let me know: |atp-mailing-list|.  

	As you can see entries of the type '@string' which can be used in bib
	files are not supported (i.e. there is no function which substitutes
	the variables defined in @string to their values), but it is doable.
			@string{ Name = Value }
			
================================================================================
COMPLETION			                        *atp-completion*

The completion is by default mapped to <Tab>. For example if you type
\math<Tab> you will get a list of choices which completes this command. (See
':h popupmenu-completion' and ':h completion' for more).

							*atp-completion-expert-mode*
							*atp-completion-non-expert-mode*
There are two completion algorithm: expert mode  and non expert mode: the
keyword for completion in expert mode must match at the beginning, in non
expert mode any where. Also in expert mode the list of possible completions is
smaller (for example there is no '\lneqq', there is only '\lneq').

Note: Non expert mode doesn't check if you are editing math (see
|g:atp_MathOpened|), and is useful when you want to complete a non-math
command inside mathematics.

							*atp-Tab-note*
If you prefer to not map <Tab> key then you can define g:atp_no_tab_map=1 in
your vimrc file or atprc file |atprc|. Note that Vim can add/remove
tabshift width from the beginning of line in other ways: in normal mode with
|>>| and |<<|, in insert mode: |i_CTRL-T|, |i_CTRL-D| and in visual mode with
|>| and |<|. Also you can use |atp-g>| and |atp-g<|. The alignment of tabular
and other environments can be done with |atp-:TexAlign| command. 

You can switch off/on completion modes adjusting the variable
'g:atp_completion_active_modes', all names of completion modes are stored in
the variable 'g:atp_tab_completion_modes'.

							*g:atp_local_completion*
If |g:atp_local_completion| is set to non zero value, then input files will be
scanned for \def, \newcommand, \newnevironment and \newtheorem commands and
they will be used for completion (with |atp-:LocalCommands|). If its value is
1 then this will be done during first completion, if it is set to 2 then this
will be done at start up. The default value is 2 when vim has |+python|
feature otherwise it is 1. With |+python| this is done at every time you
use the Tab completion.

NOTE: if you press <Tab> but then you changed your mind, the completion pop-up
menu allows to cancel completion: press ctrl+p (i.e.  go up - some times more
than once) and then press <space>.

Note: Completion checks the preamble for definitions of LaTeX packages. If
a supported package is present (for example: tikz) then the completion will
contain additional commands. If you add a package or a class you should unlet
corresponding variable: |g:atp_LatexPackages| and |g:atp_LatexClasses|.

							*atp-:ToggleTab*
:ToggleTab
nmap, imap `<Tab> 
    It is a command to toggle the tab map off/on: :ToggleTab, it is also mapped
    to `<Tab>. 

    Note: see |atp-Tab-note|.


COMPLETION MODES		                       	*atp-completion-modes*
							*atp-completion-commands*
	commands ~
		if g:atp_check_if_math_mode = 1 then the pull of commands
		contains math commands only if there you are inside a math
		environment. This works perfectly if you switch from $:$ and
		$$:$$ to their equivalent (and more up-to-date) \(:\) and \[:\].
		The list of math environment in which ATP will think you are
		editing a math mode is stored in the variable:
		'g:atp_math_modes'. Its entries are two element list of
		patterns which matches the beginning and end of a math mode.
		The '0' entry have to provide the beginning and end pattern of
		in line math '\(:\)', the second for displayed math '\[:\]'.
		Its default value is given below.
	
		If you add a package (like tikz or amsmath, or amssymb) then
		the set of completions will contain extra commands/environment
		names defined in these packages  Because some classes calls
		amsmath package silently setting the variable
		'g:atp_amsmath=1' will ensure that you will get completions
		for these commands. The algorithm checks if you have this
		package declared or if you use some of the standard ams
		class (actually checks if the document class name matches
		'^ams'). 

		If you do not want math commands completions at all define
		':let g:atp_no_math_command_completion=1' (you can put it in
		your |vimrc| or |atprc| file, or define while writing,
		both will work, so you can switch off the math completions
		temporarily).

		The label command completes in a special way: for example in
		a line like:
			\begin{theorem}\lab<Tab>
		will complete to 
			\begin{theorem}\label{thm:
		The dictionary of short names is 'g:atp_shortname_dict'. If
		you do not likes this idea (however it can help you to
		correctly write \ref{ - to avoid referring to lemmas as
		propositions, and also it makes completion for \ref{ nicer
		- you can list only labels for theorems), so if you do not
		want it anyway: 'let g:atp_no_short_names=1' will make the
		work. 
							*g:atp_amsmath*
		If |g:atp_amsmath|=1 or you use one of ams classes, or the
		package amsmath is found by ATP ams math commands and
		environment names will be added to the list of completions.

							*atp-variables-local_completion*
							*b:atp_LocalColors*
							*b:atp_LocalCommands*
							*b:atp_LocalEnvironments*
		By default the first time you are completing an environment
		name or a command a list of locally defined environments and
		commands is made (it takes a few seconds). If you do not want
		to completions for them define "let |g:atp_local_completion|=0",
		if |g:atp_local_completion|=2" then the search for local
		definitions and commands will be done on startup (after
		version 8.4 for this you have to switch off abbreviations by
		setting g:atp_noabbreviations to 1 - but anyway it is not time
		consuming because these variables are loaded from
		|atp-ProjectScript|).
							*atp-:LocalCommands*	
:LocalCommands[!]							
		If you added a command or an environment the command
		:LocalCommands! will update the list of local definitions.
		With bang "!" it update the list of input files
		|b:ListOfFiles| in which the search is done. The output is
		stored in three variables: >
				b:atp_LocalColors
				b:atp_LocalCommands
				b:atp_LocalEnvironments
<		If a command was declared with a arguments (i.e. using #1, or
		#1#2, etc.) a single '{' is attached. It doesn't match for
		definitions inside comments.

		Note: the python version searches for commands, environments,
		...  defined in the begining of line (with possible white
		spaces).

		Note: the python version of LocalCommands will save the
		current buffer, without saving project script and with
		'nowritebackup' and 'nobackup' set. 

							*atp-tikzpicture*
	tikzpicture ~
		There is an extended support for tikz picture environment both
		inline \tikz{:} and displayed: \begin{tikzpicture}
		\end{tikzpicture}. The completion works for both commands and
		keywords. The pull of them is enlarged if you add tikz
		libraries. Normal commands are added if you are inside {:}.

							*atp-completion-ref*
							*atp-completion-label*
							*atp-completion-cite*
	ref/label/cite ~
		For label completion puts short names, for ref and eqref
		commands the completions are the labels found in all files
		associated to the main file (the plugin searches the input
		and include files for them). The same for cite: which searches
		also in bib files defined in the main file.

		In the popup menu the first column show the label name, second
		column contains the first letter of the counter name used:
		e for equation, t for theorem, s for section, c for chapter,
		I for Item, etc. - these are the most common things you will
		see. The third column contains the value of the counter. It is
		put in brackets () if it comes from equation counter.

		There is also omni completion (CTRL-X CTRL-O, see
		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|) for \cite command. Check it out, as it is
		very nice (especially in gvim!) and very fast. 

		For both completion and omni completion for the cite command,
		the text after \cite{  [ or after a comma after \cite{ ] is
		treated as a regular expression. Thus you can write:

		\cite{.*author1\&.*author2<Tab>

		to get the completions for things written by both author 1 and
		2 (regardless of the order they appear in bib files).

		BibTeX omni completion is triggered by '\cite{', '\citep{' or
		'\citet{'.  For example, assume you have in your .bib files an
		entry looking like: >

		@book {	knuth1981,
				author = "Donald E. Knuth",
				title = "Seminumerical Algorithms",
				publisher = "Addison-Wesley",
				year = "1981" }

		Then, try: >

			\cite{Knuth 1981<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
			\cite{algo<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
<

		\ref{{pattern}<Tab> matches the label name for the {pattern}.
		When pattern is matched for a number of a label '^' is added in
		front of the pattern (see below). In this case both completion modes:
		expert and non-expert works in the same way.

		You can also use Vim patterns after '\cite{'.

<		Tab Completion for labels (|atp-completion|) allows to specify
		the number of the counter, e.g. >
					\ref{3.1<Tab>
<		will complete into the label of the counter with value '3.1'.
		As for now you can not specify which counter to complete. You
		can also write '\ref{3.1$' then '^3.1$' is used as a pattern!

		For this two work the aux file must be present.  As for now
		the aux file, if it is not present, is not made.

		This is working with the main document classes: article, book,
		review, amsart, amsbook, memoir. If for some class it is not
		working thanks for reporting me (it's enough to email me just
		the document class).

							*atp-completion-brackets*
	brackets ~
		Closing of brackets {:},{:},[:],(:) (also closes math modes \(:\) and
		\[:\]). 
		Relevant variables are: g:atp_bracket_dict a dictionary of
		brackets by default it consists of pairs '(' : ')', '{' : '}',
		'[' : ']'. There is a second dictionary g:atp_sizes_of_brackets
		which contains all the sizes of brackets in latex plus a pair
		'\' : '\', for closing the math modes: \(:\), \[:\] and the
		brackets \{:\}.
							*atp-closing-environments*
							*atp-completion-env*
	environments ~
		Completes after '\begin{' and '\end{'. For example
		'\begin{cen<Tab>' will give '\begin{center}' 
		But '\begin{theorem}<Tab>' or
		'\begin{theorem}\label{thm:1}<Tab> will close the environment.
		The algorithm tries to close environment in many natural
		situations: for example when it did found less than one command
		completion. It closes the right environment when they are
		nested (however not in right place!) and it preserves the
		indention. When after \begin{center}\label{...} XXX there is
		something (in place of XXX) it will close the environment
		after the cursor position otherwise in next line
		(\hypertarget{...}{...} command is treated like \lebl{...}).

		The environments opened in tex definitions ('\def',
		'\newcommand', '\renewcommand') will not be closed unless the
		current cursor position is in that line (sometimes one might
		want to have a definition which only opens an environment).

		If you type \begin{envname}<Tab> the cursor position will not
		change. You can use |i_CTRL-M| (|i_CTRL-J| is used by
		|atp-j_motion|) after <Tab> to open new line inside {envname}.
		Otherwise the cursor position will be right after the closing
		\end{envname}.

		See |g:atp_amsmath|.

		Examples: ~
			(the <Tab> indicates in which position the
			<Tab> can be pressed to get the described
			behaviour).

		That is, if you like to write \begin{}:\end{} in the beginning
		and end of a line this will be preserved. However, there is no
		support for nested environments then!

							*atp-completion-abbreviations*
	abbreviations ~
		There is tab completion for insert mode abbreviation names
		(use <ctrl-y> to choose one from the list and then type
		<space>, just typing <space> should also work).

							*atp-completion-fontdeclaration*
	font declarations ~
		This is completion for the commands 
		    \usefont{<encoding>}{<font_familly>}{<font_series>}{<font_shape>},
		    \fontencoding{<encoding>},
		    \fontfamily{<font_family>},
		    \fontseries{<font_series>},
		    \fontshape{<font_shape>},
		    \DeclareFixedFont{<cmd>}{<encoding>}{<font_familly>}{<font_series>}{<font_shape>}{<size>}
		
		It first splits the line and take a part between the commands
		\selectfont (if there is not \selectfont command this step is
		omitted).

		Then if the <encoding> is declared the font families for the
		completion will only come from this <encoding>.

		If <font_family> is defined, <font_series> and <font_shape>
		come from the particular font definition file (the declared
		encoding is used if not the value of
		|g:atp_font_encoding| is used).

		If <font_family> and <font_series> are defined then the
		<font_shape> for this font (in the above encoding) is found.
		
							*atp-completion-bibstyle*
	bibstyle ~
		Completion for the command '\bibliographystyle{'. Finds all
		"bst" files available in your tex distribution. 

							*atp-completion-documentclass*
	documentclass ~
		Completion for the command '\documentclass'. Returns list of
		all classes available in your distribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------
ATP COMPLETION VARIABLES				*atp-completion-variables*

These are all variables which can help to customise the completion:
(if the value is given it is the default, if it is not means it is too long to
put it here).
							*g:atp_completion_limits*
>
 	g:atp_completion_limits		= [ '40', '60', '80', '100' ]
<
				The above variable specifies how long should
				atp plugin search for closed/unclosed environments:
				the first value	 - search for \(:\)  [ in line math ]
				the second	 - search for \[:\]  [ displayed math ]
				the third	 - search for \begin{<env>:\end{<env>	
				the fourth	 - for environments defined in
						   the variable g:atp_long_environments

				You can also put "-1" as the values of
				g:atp_completion_limits, then the search
				forward/backward will last till first/last
				line. However, this makes it run slower.
							*g:atp_long_environments*
>
 	g:atp_long_environments 	= []
<	
				If some of your environments are very long put
				their names in this list. Do not forget that is
				environment <env> is long and is put inside
				environment <center> then <center> is also
				long!
				 
				However, this will not close long environments
				(for that you have to change the third
				argument of g:atp_completion_limits !). This
				just prevents closing environments which are
				closed and to long to see that.

OMNI-COMPLETION 					*atp-omnicompletion*
by David Munger (LatexBox plugin)

Completion is achieved through omni completion |compl-omni|, with default
bindings <CTRL-X><CTRL-O>. There are four types of completion:



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

							*atp-omnicompletion-commands*
Commands ~

Command completion is triggered by the '\' character.  For example, >
	\beg<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
completes to >
	\begin{

Associated settings:
	|atp-g:LatexBox_completion_commands|
	|atp-g:LatexBox_completion_close_braces|


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

							*atp-omnicompletion-environments*
Environments ~

Environment completion is triggered by '\begin{'.  For example, >
	\begin{it<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
completes to >
	\begin{itemize}

Completion of '\end{' automatically closes the last open environment.

Associated settings:
	|atp-g:LatexBox_completion_environments|
	|atp-g:LatexBox_completion_close_braces|


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

							*atp-omnicompletion-labels*
Labels ~

Label completion is triggered by '\ref{' or '\eqref{'.  For example, >
	\ref{sec:<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
offers a list of all matching labels, with their associated value and page number.
Labels are read from the aux file, so label completion works only after
compilation.

It matches:
	1. Labels: >
		\ref{sec:<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
<	2. Numbers: >
		\eqref{2<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
<	3. Labels and numbers together (separated by whitespace): >
		\eqref{eq 2<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
	

Associated settings:
	|atp-g:LatexBox_ref_pattern|
	|atp-g:LatexBox_completion_close_braces|


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

							*atp-omnicompletion-bibtex*
BibTeX entries ~

BibTeX completion is triggered by '\cite{', '\citep{' or '\citet{'.
For example, assume you have in your .bib files an entry looking like: >

	@book {	knuth1981,
		author = "Donald E. Knuth",
		title = "Seminumerical Algorithms",
		publisher = "Addison-Wesley",
		year = "1981" }

Then, try: >

	\cite{Knuth 1981<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
	\cite{algo<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>

You can also use regular expressions (or Vim patterns) after '\cite{'.

Associated settings:
*atp-g:LatexBox_cite_pattern*		Default: '\\cite\(p\|t\)\?\*\?\_\s*{'
*atp-g:LatexBox_ref_pattern*		Default: '\\v\?\(eq\|page\)\?ref\*\?\_\s*{'

	Patterns to match \cite and \ref commands for BibTeX and label completion.
	Must include the trailing '{'.
	To match all commands that contain 'cite' (case insensitive), use: >
		let g:LatexBox_cite_pattern = '\c\\\a*cite\a*\*\?\_\s*{'
<	To match all commands that end with 'ref' (case insensitive): >
		let g:LatexBox_ref_pattern = '\c\\\a*ref\*\?\_\s*{'
<	Both examples match commands with a trailing star too.

*atp-g:LatexBox_bibtex_wild_spaces*		Default: 1

	If nonzero, spaces act as wildcards ('.*') in completion.
	For example, if nonzero, >
		\cite{Knuth 1981
<	is equivalent to >
		\cite{Knuth.*1981

*atp-g:LatexBox_completion_close_braces*	Default: 1

	If nonzero, omni completion will add closing brackets where relevant.
	For example, if nonzero, >
		\begin{itemize
<	completes to >
		\begin{itemize}

*atp-g:LatexBox_completion_environments*
*atp-g:LatexBox_completion_commands*

	Static completion lists for environments
	|atp-omnicompletion-environments| and commands
	|atp-omnicompletion-commands|.


================================================================================
HOW TO CONFIGURE ATP TO YOUR NEEDS                      *atp-configure*
							*atp-variables*

There are several options you can set, and they might be set in your Vimrc
file. The default values are given below (except the completion setup and
bibtex documented above). Note: not all variables are listed below.

All the values of important variables with their values can be shown
(grepped) by |atp-:ShowOptions| command.

							*atprc*
$HOME/.atprc.vim (only on Unix and GNU/Linux) or 
$VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/ATP_files/atprc.vim					
    A configuration file for ATP. You do not have to use autocommands to set
    local-buffer variables, just place them here. The settings in |atprc| file
    override the values in the project script (|atp-ProjectScript|). You can
    also overwrite the plugin maps there it you want to have different
    behaviour on the key map used by ATP.

Tip: If you want to see (almost) all the variables, type ':let g:atp_<CTRL_D>',
and ':let b:atp_<CTRL_D>'.

All buffer variables (see |b:var|), i.e. these which name begins with "b:",
should be set in your |vimrc| or |atprc| file. If you want to use your vimrc file
then the best way to do that is by using an autocommand:
>
	au BufReadPre *.tex let b:atp_TexCompiler="latex"
<
If you put just let |b:atp_TexCompiler|, this will also work but not always: for
example when you open a new buffer in existing Vim session. However, if you
put them in your |atprc| it is enough to use the standard "let b:...=".
							*b:atp_TexCompiler*
>
 let b:atp_TexCompiler	= "pdflatex"			
<	Used by functions: TEX() (map \l, imap \l), VTEX() (map <F5>, imap <F5>)

	You can set it to latex, tex, luatex, and so on and possibly to
	lilypond as well.  

	There is a command to set this variable with nice completion, see
	|atp-:Compiler|. 
							*b:atp_TexCompilerVariable*
>
 let b:atp_TexCompilerVariable = "max_print_line=2000" 	
<	You can use it to set an environment variables for the compiler. The
	"max_print_line" sets the maximal length of a line in the log file.
	The value 2000 is high enough to prevent line breaking.

	Note: the gramar for this variable: it should be a semicolon separated
	list of variables and values, i.e. 'variable_1=value_1;variable_2=value_2'
							*b:atp_BibCompiler*
>
 let b:atp_BibCompiler	= "bibtex"			
<	This variable sets the bibtex backend. There are other programs which
	might be used, for example biber and pybib (not tested with ATP).
	
	The default value will be "biber" if the preamule contains
	\usepackge[backend=biber]{biblatex}. If it is set to "biber" ATP will
	adjust |g:atp_keep| variable (add run.xml, bcf extensions) when you use
	|atp-:TEX|, |atp-:Bibtex|, or |atp-:MakeLatex| commands.

							*b:atp_TexFlavor*
>
 let b:atp_TexFlavor	= "tex"	
<	If you are editing a plain tex file it is automatically set to
	'plaintex', then you get highlighting for $$:$$. Some other features
	are planned (you can also set this while editing a 'tex' file, i.e.
	latex document but using $$:$$ is latex is not recommended it is know
	to break some latex specific things).
							*b:atp_TexOptions*
>
 let b:atp_TexOptions	= "-synctex=1"			
<	This is a comma ',' sepparated list of TeX compiler options. If you
	want to set some additional options to your tex compiler you can use
	this variable, note that '-output-directory' and '-interaction' are
	set by ATP. 

							*b:atp_OutDir*
>
 let b:atp_OutDir	= fnameescape(fnamemodify(resolve(b:atp_MainFile,":h")) . "/"
<	This is the directory in which tex will put the output files. If the
	open file is not a symbolic link it is equal to the directory in which
	the tex file is located. If the open file is a symbolic link it points
	to the directory in which the real file is located. 
	
	If you set this variable to './' (or '.') and change the current
	working directory for example to /tmp (:cd /tmp) then the latex output
	will be placed in /tmp, i.e. it will move with with cd. However, the
	default value of b:atp_OutDir is not affected by :cd command.

	White spaces and other characters should not be escaped. It will be
	quoted in '...' using the |shellescape()| function.

	You can see the current output directory in the status (it is in the
	short notation) to see it whole type:
		:echo b:atp_OutDir
	or use the |atp-:ShowOptions| command.		

	If in your environment the variable $TEXMFOUTDIR is set the value of
	b:atp_OutDir will be set to its value.

							*b:atp_auruns*
>
 let b:atp_auruns	= 1				
<	This variable control how many times the automatic function calls tex
	compiler (consecutively). It is useful if you are working with PDF
	files and you want to have bookmarks (you can get them using hyperref
	package with the option: bookmarks. Then set b:atp_auruns to '2'.

							*b:atp_running*
>
 b:atp_running						
<	This variable stores the current number of running instances of latex.
	When it is greater than 1 a message in the status line is shown. If :PID
	command returns that no latex is running this variable this variable
	is reset to 0. 
							*g:atp_MathVimOptions*
>
 g:atp_MathVimOptions	= { 'textwidth' : '0' }
<	This variable is a dictionary of Vim settings and its values which
	will be valid when you edit mathematics inside the pairs \(:\), $:$,
	\[:\], $$:$$ (only in plain tex files or if g:atp_TexFlavour
	= 'plaintex').  For example, the default value will toggle between
	your 'textwidth' in non-math and 0 in math.  The dictionary may
	contain short option names equally well as long names.

	Note: the standard tex syntax file defines other zones: for example
	for align and equation environments (and many others) but some how
	they are not accessible using synstack() function. 
			
	This feature can be turned off setting variable >
			g:atp_SetMathVimOptions
<	to '0', the default is '1'.
							*g:atp_autex_check_if_closed*
>
 let g:atp_autex_check_if_closed = 1  			
<	This feature is not implemented.
	tex run if all environments \begin:\end, \(:\) and \[:\] are closed.
	Set g:atp_autex_check_if_closed=0 in order to not make the checks.
							*g:texmf*
>
 let g:texmf	= $HOME/texmf				
<	This variable configures where input files are placed. See
	|atp-:EditInputFile|.
							*g:askforoutdir*
>
 let g:askforoutdir	= 0				
<	Its values are 1 and 0.  When it is set to 1 you will be asked for the
	name of a directory where tex will put output files, note that this
	name should end with a "/".
							*b:atp_Viewer*
>
 let b:atp_Viewer	= "okular"			
<	it was tested with Xpdf, Evince, ePdfViewer, Kpdf, Okular, Xdvi and
	they all works fine. I'm using Xpdf and the Xpdf server options are
	supported so that the file is automatically reloaded (other viewers,
	except epdfview, have this functionality as well. This do not works
	for acroread. Read more about viewers in |atp-viewers|. 

	If you use program b:atp_Viewer then you can use the variable
	b:atp_{b:atp_Viewer}Options to set the options (it is a vim list), for
	example if b:atp_Viewer="xpdf" then you might use:

							*atp-Viewers_Options*
							*b:atp_xdviOptions*
    							*b:atp_xpdfOptions*
    							*b:atp_okularOptions*
    							*b:atp_evinceOptions*
    |b:atp_xpdfOptions|
    |b:atp_xdviOptions|
    |b:atp_okularOptions|
    |b:atp_evinceOptions|, etc ... (also global variables g:atp_...Options)
	Used by function: ViewOutput() (map \v, map <F3>, imap <F3>)

	These are lists in which every viewer switch and its value should be
	placed as element (seprate!). See examples below. 

	For example, if you want to have different look of one document you can
	set it to "-bg gray20". Some examples:
>
 	let b:atp_xpdfOptions	= ['-bg', 'Grey30', '-mattecolor', 'SlateBlue2', '-papercolor', 'White']
	let g:atp_xpdfOptions	= ['-bg', 'NavajoWhite4', '-fg', 'black', '-mattecolor', 'burlywood']
	let b:atp_xdviOptions	= ['-expertmode', '0', '-s', '6']
<	
							*g:atp_XpdfServer* 
>
 let b:atp_XpdfServer=fnamemodify(expand("%"),":t")		
<	Used by function: ViewOutput() (map \v, map <F3>, imap <F3>)

	It is equal to the name of the source file. You do not need escape
	spaces in the name (shellescape() function is used before it is send
	to the shell).
							*b:atp_OpenViewer*	
>
 let b:atp_OpenViewer	= 1					
<	If the function which calls TeX compiler do not see that you are
	viewing the output file it will open it for you if b:atp_OpenViewer=1.
	Otherwise, this feature is disabled.
>
 let g:atp_delete_output	= 0
<	If set to 1 then Delete function (map <F6>d) will delete also the
	output file.	
							*g:atp_cpcmd*
>
 let g:atp_cpcmd		= "/bin/cp"
< 	This sets the copy command used by compiler. The value tries to not use
	shell internal function and to avoid the -i switch (ask if overwrite). 

							*g:atp_tex_extensions*	
>
 let g:atp_tex_extensions=["aux", "log", "bbl", "blg", "bcf", "run.xml", "spl", "snm", "nav", "thm", "brf", "out", "toc", "mpx", "idx", "maf", "blg", "glo", "mtc[0-9]", "mtc1[0-9]", "pdfsync" , "ind"]	
<
	 This list is used by the |atp-:Delete| command which deletes all the
	 files with the specified extension in the directory |b:atp_OutDir|.
							*g:atp_keep*			
>
 let g:atp_keep	= [ "log", "aux", "toc", "bbl", "ind", "idx", "synctex.gz", "blg", "loa", "toc", "lot", "lof", "thm", "out" ]
<	Files with an extension belonging to this list will be copied from
	'b:atp_OutDir' to the temporary directory with appropriate name. Then it
	will be used by (La)TeX. (log file will be copied after it is created,
	other files will be copied back and forth between 'b:atp_OutDir' and the
	temporary directory). These four elements: log,aux,toc,bbl are
	essentially minimum to work with: table of contents, pdf-bookmarks and
	bibtex. There are possibly other classes, like beamer, or packages
	like theorem (produce .thm files) which will need to configure this
	variable.

	If you use "biber" ATP will add "run.xml" and "bcf".

	You can change this variable by the command:
		:let g:atp_keep+=["spl"]
							*g:printeroptions*		
>
 let g:printeroptions	= ""				
<	You can set the printer options. These are options for the 'lpr'
	command, which will print the output file (pdf or dvi) this depends on
	the b:atp_TexCompiler that you use.
							*g:atp_TexCommand*
>
 g:atp_TexCommand						
<	This variable is for debugging purposes. It stores the last executed command to
	compile your document. It changes also when your compiler was run
	automatically. >
		:TEX
		:echo g:atp_TexCommand
		:TEX!
		:echo g:atp_TexCommand
<	It is read-only variable.	
							*b:atp_TempDir*
>
 b:atp_TempDir = b:atp_OutDir/.tmp
<	In this directory vim (or python) will make a temporary directory
	(with a unique name) to which output files will be put by your TeX
	compiler. This is done so to prevent overwriting the output file while
	the compelation is being done (this can cause problems when there are
	many TeX processes and the Viewer is accessing not yet compilated
	file). The output files are copied back to b:atp_OutDir after
	compelation. The tmporary directory is passed to your TeX compiler
	using '-output-directory' switch.  
							*g:atp_TempDir*
>
 g:atp_TempDir 
<	In this direcory the logs of ATP are stored. If vim has python support
	is created by python in most secure way available (readable only by
	the user) if not it is made using mkdir() vim function with 0700
	permissions.
							*g:atp_CompilersDict*
>
 let g:atp_CompilersDict 	= { 
		\ "pdflatex": ".pdf", 		"pdftex" 	: ".pdf", 
		\ "xetex" 	: ".pdf", 	"latex" 	: ".dvi", 
		\ "tex" 	: ".dvi",	"elatex"	: ".dvi",
		\ "etex"	: ".dvi", 	"luatex"	: ".pdf"}
<	This variable is used to associate an extension to the compiler that
	is used.

	functions.

  							*g:atp_VimCompatible*

 g:atp_VimCompatible variable
<   	with default value 0 ("no"). Its values are 0/1 or yes/no. It changes 
	the behaviour of '%'. In nocomatible mode it gen go to matching pair
	in a different line in compatible mode it find the matching pair only
	if the ending bracket is in the same line.

================================================================================
WRITING PROJECTS					*atp-ProjectFiles*
							*b:atp_MainFile*
>
 let b:atp_MainFile	= expand("%:p")
<	This variable points to the main file of the project, it is set on the
	start up to the file you open. If you edit project file (for the first
	time), start with the main file and use gf (see |atp-gf|) to go to the
	project file you want to edit. In this way all the project files will
	have correctly set this variable. The value of this variable is used
	by compilation functions. This variable is written in the project
	script (see |atp-ProjectScript|). And when the project script is on (see
	|atp-ProjectScript|, or set |b:atp_ProjectScript|=1) it is restored between
	sessions. In this way, next time, you can open any project file and
	the b:atp_MainFile variable will be set to the correct value.

							*b:TreeOfFiles*
							*b:ListOfFiles*
							*b:TypeDict*
							*b:LevelDict*
	The project feature stores more variables: |b:TreeOfFiles| a dictionary
	which contains the tree of input files, |b:ListOfFiles| - list of input
	files, |b:TypeDict| dictionary of types of input files, where the type
	is one of following: {preamble}, {input}, {bib}. The last variable is
	|b:LevelDict| which is a dictionary of input levels (for example: an
	input file in input file has level 2).

	There are other tools to make editing project files more easy. There
	is search function: |atp-:S| which works better than the Vim |:ijump|
	command, which cannot go above the current file in the tree of input
	files /but |:ijump| is much faster/. 

*b:atp_ProjectDir*
	Stores the project directory, by default where |b:atp_MainFile| is
	located (the filename is resolved if it is a symbolic link). It is not
	written to the |atp-ProjectScript| (this makes the |atp-ProjectScript|
	independent of the host when |g:atp_RelativePath| is set). This
	variable is mainly for internal purposes. If you want to set the
	output directory use |b:atp_OutDir|.

*g:atp_RelativePath*
	If set to 1 (which is the default), project variables: |b:atp_MainFile|,
	|b:TreeOfFiles|, |b:ListOfFiles|, |b:TypeDict|, |b:LevelDict| will store path
	relative to |b:atp_ProjectDir| (which is the same as path to your main
	file, however if the file is a symbolic link it will hint to the
	resolved path). The |atp-:S| will use correctly these values. This is
	particularly useful if you want to share the project file.
	 
	If you run into problems with |atp-:S| you can set this variable to
	0 and use |atp-:InputFiles| to regenerate the variables - they will
	now store the full path (the other way around also works).

:ToggleNn [on]						*atp-:ToggleNn*
	The command |atp-:ToggleNn| toggles the value of |g:atp_mapNn| variable.
	The optional argument [on] has three possible values: "",  "on" or
	"off".  The default "", toggles the value of |g:atp_mapNn|, "on" sets
	g:atp_mapNn to 1 and "off" sets it to 0.
							*g:atp_mapNn*
>
 g:atp_mapNn = 0
<	If it is set to 1 then several tools use |atp-:S| command instead of
	Vim |search()| function (which looks only in the current buffer).
	These are: 
	|atp-:NPart|, |atp-:NChap|, |atp-:NSec|, |atp-:NSSec|, |atp-:NSSSec|, 
	|atp-:PPart|, |atp-:PChap|, |atp-:PSec|, |atp-:PSSec|, |atp-:PSSSec|, 
	|atp-:NEnv|,
	|atp-:PEnv|.

	The default value of |g:atp_mapNn| is 0.

	The variable g:atp_mapNn should be always set as follows (in
	|atprc| or |vimrc| file): >
		if !exists("g:atp_mapNn")	
		    let g:atp_mapNn = 1
		endif
<	Then the value will be preserved when atp opens new buffer 
	when using |atp-:S| command. If you want to have project specific
	setting use |atp-ProjectScript|.

	Another good tip for LaTeX project files is to set |b:atp_TexFlavor|
	variable to 'tex' (in your |vimrc| or |atprc| file). This will prevent
	from situations that Vim recognizes input file as a plain TeX while it
	is an input file into a LaTeX project. 
	Another way is add options to 'viewoptions' (see |'viewoptions'|). And
	set mkview and loadview via autocommands >
		au BufWinLeave *.tex mkview
		au BufWinEnter *.tex silent loadview
<	This will ensure that filetype variable is set correctly. Some ATP tools
	behave in a different way in plaintex files. For example TreeOfFiles
	function (it makes the variables |b:TreeOfFiles|, |b:ListOfFiles|,
	|b:TypeDict|, |b:LevelDict|). It is recursive in LaTeX files but not in
	plain TeX files). On this function is based the command
	|atp-:LocalCommands| which makes list of commands, environments and
	colours for Tab Completion and also |atp-:S| command. It is done so,
	because in plain tex there is no way to distinguish input files from
	input packages which we do not want to scan (especially recursively,
	which might be time consuming). 

PROJECT SCRIPT						*atp-ProjectScript*
<	The file: |b:atp_MainFile| . ".project.vim", in the same directory as
	|b:atp_MainFile| stores values of local variables saved before Vim
	leaved a buffer (it is very similar to |View|). Also values of some global 
	variables are stored in a seprate file (oine for all tex files).

	Loading procedure searches for files which ends with .project.vim. There
	might be many such files in one directory. The file is used which contains
	the current buffer in the list |b:ListOfFiles|. If none of the project
	scripts was containing the current buffer name in |b:ListOfFiles| then new
	project script will be written for the current buffer. Before writing the
	project script file if |b:ListOfFiles| doesn't exists it will be generated
	and written.

       If the project script is stored locally the it is easier to include it
       in a revision system (bzr, svn, etc.) and share it with collaborators.

       The global project script (which, by default, stores global variables:
       |g:atp_LatexPackages|, |g:atp_LatexClasses|, |g:atp_Library|) is now
       '~/.vim/ftplugin/ATP_files/common_var.vim'.

       |atprc| file is executed before project script file (with local
       variables) and common_var.vim (with global variables) files are
       sourced. Thus this files will override the settings in |vimrc|
       and |atprc| files. 

							*b:atp_ProjectScript*
							*g:atp_ProjectScript*
	Setting one of the variables |b:atp_ProjectScript| or
	|g:atp_ProjectScript| to 0 the feature will be turned off. Local
	variable, i.e. b: has precedence over the global one g:. So you can
	turned off the feature for only specific files. The global variable
	will turn it off for all files.
	
							*b:atp_ProjectScriptFile*
>
    let b:atp_ProjectScriptFile = b:atp_MainFile.".project.vim"
<	This variables stores the name of local project script file.

	Local and global variables are supported. The local variables which
	are cached in this way are listed in 
							*g:atp_ProjectLocalVariables*
>
    let g:atp_ProjectLocalVariables = [
		\ "b:atp_MainFile", 	"g:atp_mapNn", 		"b:atp_autex", 
		\ "b:atp_TexCompiler", 	"b:atp_TexFlavor", 	"b:atp_OutDir" , 
		\ "b:atp_auruns", 	"b:atp_ReloadOnErr", 	"b:atp_OpenViewer", 
		\ "b:atp_XpdfServer",	"b:atp_ProjectDir", 	"b:atp_Viewer",
		\ "b:TreeOfFiles",	"b:ListOfFiles", 	"b:TypeDict",
		\ "b:LevelDict", 	"b:atp_BibCompiler",	"b:atp_StarEnvDefault",
		\ "b:atp_StarMathEnvDefault"
		\ ] 
<	If your vim doesn't have python support |+python| three more variables
	are stored: |b:atp_LocalEnvironments| |b:atp_LocalCommands|, and
	|b:atp_LocalColors|. With |+python| this is not needed since
	|atp-:LocalCommands| is then very fast and is run on |BufEnter|.

	Each file has separate project scrips which stores the values of
	these variables. It's name is stored in |b:atp_ProjectScriptFile|.

							*atp-ProjectScript_Global*	
	There is also file for variables for all projects. It stores values of
	global variables (by default it is "ftplugin/ATP_files/common_var.vim". 
	The global variables that are written in this file are given in Vim
	list: 
    							*g:atp_ProjectGlobalVariables*
>
		let g:atp_ProjectGlobalVariables = [ 
			\ 'g:atp_LatexPackages', 	
			\ 'g:atp_LatexClasses', 
			\ 'g:atp_Library' ]
<
	If you want to disable this feature for some reason you can set: >
		let g:atp_ProjectScript = 0
<	or >
		let b:atp_ProjectScript = 0
<	if you want to disable this feature only for a given buffer. 
	(The value of local variable overrides the value of global one!).
	Hint: (if you want to disable loading project script for one file): 
	    In your .vimrc file you can set the local variable via
	    autocommand group BufEnter or you can put an if statement in your
	    |atprc| file: >
		if expand("%:p") == <path_to_file>
		    let b:atp_ProjectScript = 0
		endif
<	    or you can add to the project scrpit: 
		 (1) write in its first line 'finish', or
		 (2) include in it 'let |b:atp_ProjectScript| = 0'.

	There are these commands: ~
:LoadProjectScript[!] [local/common]			*atp-:LoadProjectScript*
:WriteProjectScript[!] [local/common]			*atp-:WriteProjectScript*
:DeleteProjectScript[!] [local/common]			*atp-:DeleteProjectScript*
:ToggleProjectScript[!] [on/off]			*atp-:ToggleProjectScript*

	which do the obvious thing (if |g:atp_ProjectScript|=0 or |b:atp_ProjectScript|=0 they
	will not work). The default value of the optional argument is "local".
	:DeleteProjectScript [local] command (with optional argument [local]) deletes
	the project script file for the current buffer (only the local one), with
	bang "!" it deletes also globa project scrip. The bang of
	:WriteProjectScript forces to write to project script even when
	project script is turned off (|b:atp_ProjectScript|==0 or
	!exists("|b:atp_ProjectScript|") && |g:atp_ProjectScript|==0).

	The command ':ToggleProjectScript [on/off]' turns on/off the feature
	for this buffer (it sets |b:atp_ProjectScript|). When no argument is
	given it will toggle the value. With bang it also sets the global
	variable |g:atp_ProjectScript|. |b:atp_ProjectScript| is by default in the >
	    g:atp_ProjectLocalVariables 
<	so it will be restored afterwards. |b:atp_ProjectScript| if defined
	overrides the value of global variable |g:atp_ProjectScript|. So you can set
	in your atp file g:atp_ProjectScript = 0 and for some files using the
	if-construction: >
		let g:atp_ProjectScript = 0
		if expand("%:t") == "myfile.tex"
		    let b:atp_ProjectScript = 1
		endif
<	will turn on the feature only for myfile.tex. Something more elaborate
	would be to set |b:atp_ProjectScript| only for files with modification time
	less than two days for example.

	Note: If you delete the project script for the current buffer it will be
	written after exiting Vim, unless you turn off the project feature.

	The project script is disabled for files which full path matches
	"texmf".  With the optional bang |atp-:LoadProjectScript| loads the
	common project script also for them. |atp-:WriteProjectScript| command
	will write the project script disregarding if the file is under texmf
	directory or not.

	Note: If you use this feature, you might need to use the commands:
	|atp-:LocalCommands| and |atp-:InputFiles| which will update
	b:atp_LocalCommands, b:atp_LocalColors, b:atp_LocalEnvironments and
	|b:TreeOfFiles|, |b:ListOfFiles|, |b:TypeDict| and |b:LevelDict|. Use
	these commands with a bang "!". The second set of variables is also
	updated by |atp-:S| (also with "!") and and |atp-:GotoFile| (with "!"
	as well).

	Note: Also when you add a package to tex you should remove the common
	project scrip, so that the new packages will be added to completion
	list. 

								*atp-:S*
:S[!] /{pattern}/ [flags]
	The pattern is a Vim pattern (with 'magic'). With bang "!" it
	regenerates the tree of input files.

	This is command does the same job as |/| but is recursive in the tree
	of files (so it is useful only in project files). The syntax of this
	command is similar to |:vimgrep|. 

	This works similarly to |:ijump|. But also goes back to the root file
	(b:atp_MainFile).

	It sets the alternate file to the buffer from which the search begun.
	Note that this means that if nothing was found the alternate file
	before search will be lost.

	The {pattern} is any Vim pattern as described in |pattern| (it was only
	tested with 'magic' set on).
			
	The supported [flags] are 'bcewW'. Their meaning is the same as flags
	for |search()| function. 

	You can enclose the pattern with any non-ID character (see
	|'isident'|) instead of /, as far as it does not appear in the
	{pattern}. Examples: >
			    :S pattern\_swith\_sspaces
<	will work but: >
			    :S pattern with spaces
<	will not.		

	Note that the function might be slow when the project files where not
	yet opened.

	There is a function to check where the input file is on the hard drive
	if the name in the input command doesn't include the full path.  It
	asks kpsewhich which directories to search, filters out 
	directories which are not under '/home' (I assume that there is your
	local texmf tree) and also directories which name contains one of the
	two keywords 'texlive' and 'kpsewhich'. This makes the searching
	faster. 
							*atp-:S_input*
	Furthermore, the command is designed so that it can find all patterns
	'\\input' (and thus easily find next/previous input file). You can
	use: >
		:S \\input
		:S \\input b 
<	and you can use |n| and |N| Vim normal commands. 
	Note that it if you go backward, then it means that it will find the
	most deep line, e.g.:
>
		file.tex
			----
			----
			\input{file.1} ---->  -------
					      -------
					      \input{file.1.1}
					      -------
	                ----X	 			      
<	':S /\\input/ b' in the X position fill find \input{file.1.1} assuming 
	file.1.1.tex doesn't includes any other file. 


	The pattern can be '\\input'. Then it goes recursively to the first
	input line. 
	
							*atp-:NInput* 	*atp->i*   *atp->gf*
							*atp-:PInput* 	*atp-<i*   *atp-<gf*
	Now it also doesn't search inside commented input files. There two
	commands:
:NInput, nmap ]gf, nmap >i
:PInput, nmap [gf, nmap <i
	which finds the next/previous input line (also commented). See
	|atp-:S_input| to find how it works. They depend on |g:atp_mapNn|, if
	1 |atp-S:| is used if 0 Vim |search()| function. To repeat search you
	can use |n| and |N| Vim normal commands. These commands omit comment
	lines.

================================================================================
MAPS 		                     			*atp-mappings* 
							*atp-maps*

Lots of mappings which are given here uses #. This is a convenient map on
British keyboards, but not in the US layout, you can change them for '`' or
some other key that it is not used in Vim (there are not many of them though).
The most commonly used latex-suite plugin uses similar set of mappings (but
there might be some differences). The easy way to change imap leaders is by
using the variables:
							*g:atp_imap_first_leader*
>
	    g:atp_imap_first_leader == "#"
<	    	for Greak letters and some math commands,
							*g:atp_imap_second_leader*
>
	    g:atp_imap_second_leader == "##"
<	    	for font commands, (another good choice is "_") 
							*g:atp_imap_third_leader*
>
	    g:atp_imap_third_leader == "]"
<	    	for environments, 
							*g:atp_imap_fourth_leader*
>
	    g:atp_imap_fourth_leader == "["
<	    	for extra environments in the old layout (this will be removed).

							|g:atp_map_forward_motion_leader|
>
	    g:atp_map_forward_motion_leader == ">"
<		for maps to |atp-:NInput|, |atp-:NSec|, .... , |atp->E|, |atp->e|.
							|g:atp_map_backward_motion_leader|
>
	    g:atp_map_backward_motion_leader == "<"
<		for maps to |atp-:PInput|, |atp-:PSec|, .... , |atp-<E|, |atp-<e|. 

Note: the best way to list mappings with leader '#' in insert mode is to use
      ':imap #<CR>'.

You can list imaps with |atp-:HelpMathIMaps| and |atp-:HelpEnvIMaps| but the
best way is to use |imap| directly.

All other mappings (|map|, |vmap|, |nmap|, ...) are using |<LocalLeader>| which can be
altered with the option |maplocalleader|. A good alternate solution is to use "_"
instead of "##".

Maps are using the <buffer> option thus are local to the buffer. To unmap you
also have to use this option, for example to unmap \l issue the command:
>
	:unmap <buffer> <LocalLeader>l
<
The maps are loaded unless you set one of variables: 'g:no_plugin_maps' or
'g:no_atp_maps' (disables maps defined in tex_atp.Vim), 'g:no_atp_toc_maps'
(disables maps defined in 'toc_atp.Vim'),  'g:atp_no_env_maps' (disables the
environment maps '[*', ']*') or 'g:atp_no_tab_map' (disables the tab map
for completion, then completion is mapped to <F7> and <S-F7> (for the non
expert mode) but there is no map for 'WrapSelection()', you have to provide 
one by your self).

Note: in all mappings '\' is set to your |<LocalLeader>| (and thus, in fact, the
maps listed below might differ).

Note: The list of commands might not be complete.

Note: There are many internal maps defined |<Plug>|, they are not documented,
but you can easily find them (you can start with
ftplugin/ATP_files/mappings.vim, where they are used in rhs of maps or you can
search for them inside the scripts). 

Note: you might like to use |'notimeout'| and |'nottimeout'| settings.
However, they require that there are no maps such that no lhs is a subset ot
the another, i.e. like "ab" and "abc". With the default settings it is
shouldn't be a problem.

						*atp-j_motion* *atp-k_motion*
imap <Ctrl-j>, imap <Ctrl-k>	- these are two motions (based on syntax)
which help to navigate thought brackets (but not only) in insert mode.
   
map <Ctrl-j>, map <Ctrl-k> 	- as above but in normal mode.

	These motions emulate the behaviour of latex-suite place holder system <++>,
	without putting the placeholder into tex file.

	Comment/Uncomment lines (both in |Normal| and |Visual| modes). 

	Comment leader can be set with the variable g:atp_CommentLeader (by
	default it is '% '). If you do not want this maps or you want to
	remap them to something else you can set |g:atp_MapCommentLines|=0 in
	your |vimrc| or |atprc| file and use <Plug>CommentLines,
	<Plug>UnCommentLines (these are normal maps), for example:
		nmap <LocalLeader>C 	<Plug>UnCommentLines

								*atp-<space>*
cmap <buffer> <C-Space> 	\_s\+
cmap <buffer> <C-_> 		\_s\+
    The <C-Space> map doesn't work in Vim, instead <C-@> is used which works
    as <C-Space>. In Vim, and gVim as well, you can also use |atp-Q/|,
    |atp-Q?| or |atp-<F2>| where <Space> is mapped to \_s\+.
								*atp-Q/*
								*atp-Q?*

ENVIRONMENT IMAPS				*atp-imap-environments*
						*g:atp_imap_ShortEnvIMaps*
g:atp_imap_ShortEnvIMaps=1 
    By default the short environment imaps are defined, but if you set this
    variable to 0 you will get three letter abbreviations.  The only clashes
    is for proof (pro) and proposition (Pro) environments and itemize (ite)
    and \item (I). You can also reconfigure them using the variables:
    g:atp_imap_{env_name} (for example g:atp_imap_theorem, if you don't want
    a map for particular environment set the corresponding variable to empty
    string ""), |g:atp_imap_third_leader| is used as a leader (the default is
    ]).  Map for letter environment is not defined when you use short imaps.

Note: you can list this mappings using the command |atp-:HelpEnvIMaps|.
Note: This can be effectivly set only in |atprc| or |vimrc| files.

    These maps are fully customizable: both sides: the lhs and rhs side ! Here
    is how you can set the rhs:
						*g:atp_EnvNameTheorem*
						*g:atp_EnvNameProposition*
						*g:atp_EnvNameLemma*
						*g:atp_EnvNameCorollary*
						*g:atp_EnvNameRemark*
						*g:atp_EnvNameNote*
						*g:atp_EnvNameDefinition*
    This variables defines environment names put it the following environment imaps.

							*b:atp_StarEnvDefault*
    b:atp_StarEnvDefault variable with value "*" or "" (the default). This
    star is added to theorem like environment imaps (|atp-imap-environments|).
    By default it will be restored by the project script. See
    |g:atp_ProjectLocalVariables|.

    							*b:atp_StarMathEnvDefault*	
    b:atpStarMathEnvDefault variable with values "*" or "" (the default).  It
    is added to align and equation imaps (|atp-imap-environments|).  By
    default it will be restored by the project script. See
    |g:atp_ProjectLocalVariables|.

	This map has more features: if the preceding line is of the form:
		\item[(1)]
	then using this map in a next line will result with
		\item[(2)]
	This will work for other types of items, (1) -> (2), 1) -> 2),
	[1] -> [2], 1. -> 2. and also (a) -> (b), b) -> c), [c] -> [d],
	but also (1a) -> (1b).

			\end{letter}
							*g:atp_letter_opening*
							*g:atp_letter_closing*
    By default g:atp_letter_opening and g:atp_letter_closing are ''.


Next three sets of imaps: |atp-imap-math|, |atp-imap-math-misc| and
|atp-imap-diacritics| define imaps with overlaping keys (lhs), but note that
first two are defined only in math environment, while the last only in non
math environment. In this way `' in math environment will produce \acute{}
while in non math \'{}. 

 							*atp-imap-math-misc*
							*g:atp_imap_math_misc*
MATH IMAPS MISC						*g:atp_imap_define_math_misc*

    These imaps are defined in |g:atp_imap_math_misc| variable (except ]m and ]M
    imaps). They might be turned off usgin |atp-:ToggleIMaps| commands or
    by setting |g:atp_imap_define_math_misc| variable to 0 (this should also
    work on the fly).

    These are very useful mappings for typing mathematics.  Some of the ideas
    were taken from TeX_9 by Elias Toivanen and also AuTeX by Carl Mueller.

    Note: you might not see them using |:imap| unless the last cursor position in
	  insert mode was inside mathematics.

AuTeX maps: ~
imap __ 	_{}<Left>
imap ^^		^{}<Left>
    You can set the leader for these two maps using g:atp_imap_subscript,
    g:atp_imap_supscript variables. If you do not have any maps which begins
    with _ or ^ then you can set them to _ and ^, if this is the case thes
    maps will not be fired if you type \_ or \^ (which means literal _ or ^ in
    LaTeX). 

imap ]m 	\[\]<Left><Left>
imap ]M 	\[\]<Left><Left>

imap #\		\setminus
imap #/		\frac{}{}
imap #&		\wedge
imap #ve	\vee
imap #V		\Vee
imap #N		\Nabla
imap #=		\equiv
imap `8		\infty		[the default '#' is not working, ` is used intead, 
				 but only if |g:atp_imap_first_leader|='#']
imap `6		\partial	[as above, you can also use \p<Tab>]
imap #@		\circ
imap #=		\equiv
imap #*		\bigcap
imap #+		\bigcup
imap #\		\backslash
imap #>		\geq
imap #<		\leq
imap #.		\dot		[#.s will put \dots]

MATH ACCENTS ~

These imaps are defined in g:atp_iap_math_misc variable. They might be turned
off usgin |atp-:ToggleIMaps| commands or |g:atp_imap_define_math_misc| variable.

imap ``		\grave{}
imap `'		\acute{}
imap `>		\vec{}
imap `.		\dot{}
imap `v		\check{}
imap `_		\bar{}
imap `~		\tilde{}	[if g:atp_imap_wide is nonempty it is \widetilde{}]
imap `^		\hat{}		[as above]


 							*atp-imap-math*
							*g:atp_imap_math*
MATH IMAPS						*g:atp_imap_define_math*

    These imaps are defined in |g:atp_imap_math| variable (except ]m and ]M
    imaps). They might be turned off usgin |atp-:ToggleIMaps| commands or
    |g:atp_imap_define_math| variable (be setting it to 0, works on the fly).

    For convienience, there are:
imap ~~		\tilde{}	
imap ~^		\hat{}		[^^ is used for ^{}]		

    The last two maps and the following maps work around |'timeout'| vim
    setting (behave like |'notimeout'| was set):

imap ==		&=
imap =~		\cong
imap ~~		\approx

imap ++		\sum
imap o+		\oplus
imap O+		\bigoplus
imap o-		\ominus
imap o.		\odot
imap O.		\bigodot
imap o*		\otimes
imap O*		\bigotimes
imap s+		\cup		[    set +]		/set = set theoretic/
imap s-		\setminus	[    set -]
imap S+		\bigcup		[big set +]
imap s*		\cap		[    set *]
imap S*		\bigcap		[big set *]
imap c*		\prod		[    cat *]		/cat = categorical/
imap c+		\coprod		[    cat +]
imap <=		\leq
imap >=		\geq
imap t<		\triangleleft
imap t>		\triangleright
imap s<		\subseteq	[    set <]
imap s>		\supseteq	[    set >]

    If you want to write 'o*' you can wait until |'timeoutlen'| passes or
    write 'o *' (TeX in math mode doesn't see spaces).

 						*atp-imap-diacritics*
						*g:atp_imap_define_diacritics*
DIACRITICS					*g:atp_imap_diacritics*

These imaps are defined in g:atp_imap_math variable.  They might be turned off
usgin |atp-:ToggleIMaps| commands or |g:atp_imap_define_diacritics| variable
(be setting it to 0, works on the fly).

    imap `'	\'{}
    imap `"	\"{}
    imap `^	\^{}
    imap `v	\v{}
    imap `b	\b{}
    imap `d	\d{}
    imap ``	\`{}
    imap `H	\H{}
    imap `~	\~{}
    imap `.	\.{}
    imap `c	\c{}
    imap `t	\t{}

							*atp-:ToggleIMaps*
:ToggleIMaps
nmap, imap '<Tab> 
    This command toggles off/on impas defined in the vim lists
    g:atp_imap_math, g:atp_imap_math_misc and g:atp_imap_diacritics plus imaps
    to _{} and ^{}.

LOG FILE MAPS						*atp-maps-log*
    This are available maps in the log file, when it was opened with
    |atp-:OpenLog| command >
	]e, [e 		- go to next/previous error message in log file 
	]w, [w		- go to next/previous warning message in log file 
	]c, [c		- go to next/previous citation warning message in log file 
	]r, [r		- go to next/previous reference warning message in log file 
	]i, [i		- go to next/previous info message in log file 
	]f, [f		- go to next/previous font info message in log file 
	]p, [p		- go to next/previous font package message in log file 
	]P, [P		- go to next/previous page in log file
	%		- searchpair for (:).
<	You can use |n| and |N| Vim normal commands to repeat previous search [count] times.

================================================================================
ABBREVIATIONS						*atp-abbreviations*

    The following abbreviations are defined:
	+- for \pm
	+| for \dagger
	++ for \ddager
	=<env_name>= for environments. 

    You can use |atp-completion| (<Tab>) for abbreviation names, see
    |atp-completion-abbreviations|.

    Locally defined environments are also supported (the one defined in
    |b:atp_LocalEnvironments|). If you need something different than
    abbreviation for
	\begin{theorem}
	     <Cursor placed here>
	\end{theorem}
    for example:
	\begin{corollary}<Cursor placed here>
	\end{corollary}
    You can set the variable g:atp_abbreviation_{environment_name}. It is list
    with two elements. First is used after \begin{...} and the second after
    \end{...}. For the above examples:
	let g:atp_abbreviation_theorem		= [ '<CR>', '<ESC>O' ]
	let g:atp_abbreviation_corollary	= [ '<CR>', '<ESC><UP>A' ]
    The first one is the default so you do not need to set it. In the second
    example the abbreviation command will look like: >
	abbreviate =corollary= \begin{corollary}<CR>\end{corollary}<ESC><UP>A
<   This will only work for b:atp_LocalEnvironments, LaTeX and AMS
    environments are set accordingly.
    Environment name abbreviations are defined only if there were not defined.
    So you can override the settings using |atprc| file (or |vimrc| file).

    Furthermore, you can change the "=":
    							*g:atp_iabbrev_leader*
    let g:atp_iabbrev_leader = "="
	It is used  in insert mode abbreviations like: =theorem=. 

================================================================================
DEBUGGING						*atp-errors*
    This section describes some limitation of ATP (as you see, this section is
    not written, but the aim is to make it disappear anyway ;).

    There are many debug variables with names g:atp_debug{fname} where {fname} is
    a shortname of the function for which it will turn on the debug info. These
    variables are documented in ftplugin/ATP_files/options.vim file.

							*atp-errors-bibsearch*
    A possible error which may occur using the :BibSearch commands has a simple
    cause: we count number of brackets '()', '{}' and '"' (but nor '\"') to see
    where the bib entry ends and where to join lines. The message error is echoed
    when more than 30 lines where processed and the matching bracket was not found
    (or the number of '"' is odd). Look at your bib file at the specified
    position.  Syntax highlighting for bib files can help you finding where such
    an error is located. (After reading the bib file comment lines and lines which
    begin with @string are removed, so that the brackets in comment lines do not
    count.)

================================================================================
EDITING TOOLS							*atp-editing*

								*atp-visual*
	visual mode: ie, iE, ae, im, am, ip, ap, iS, aS, <LocalLeader>sc normal
	and mode: <LocalLeader>sc. 

	They select the current environment in two ways: >
				i 	- inner
				a 	- outer
				e 	- environment 
				p	- paragraph	  
				m	- math zones: \(:\), $:$, \[:\], $$:$$, 
					  or math environment \begin:\end.ard
					  search is set by ATP
				)	- bracket
				s	- syntax
<								*atp-vie* *atp-viE* *atp-vae*
	ie, iE, ae select environment: from the nearest \begin (top) to the nearest \end (bottom).	

		'viE' selects a bit more than 'vie' but less than 'vae', it
		selects a bracket pair before the beginning of the inner part
		of an environment, so it can be environment name or an option
		just after. 	

								*atp-vim* *atp-vam*
	im, am	selects mathematics.
								*atp-vip* *atp-vap*
	ip, ap  selects paragraph. 
		In inner mode: from the nearest >
			\begin, \end, \par, \newline or empty line (top) 
<		to the nearest >
			\begin, \end, \par, \newline or empty line (bottom).
<		in outer mode: from the nearest >
			\par or empty line (top) 
<		to the nearest >
			\par or empty line (bottom).
<								*atp-viS* *atp-vaS*
	iS, aS	selects using syntax stack (see |synstack()|), inner is the
		top element in the syntax stack (the highlighted area will be
		small) and outer uses the most bottom element in the syntax
		stack (the resulting are will be wide). Some syntax groups are
		filtered out (like 'texDocZone') which not always are
		synchronised.
								*atp-select-comments*
								*atp-_c*
	_c	
		select comment lines which begin with '^\s*%'. If not in
		comment line, end visual mode. You can change this map with
		variables g:atp_MapSelectComment (this can be only changed in
		atprc or vimrc file, you need restart Vim, or use
		|atp-:ReloadATP|) .

								*atp-gw*	
nmap gw
	Quite useful normal map: m`vipgq``. It is mapped to gw (in normal
	mode).

								*atp-g<*
								*atp-g>*	
nmaps: g>, g<, 2g>, ..., 6g>  
	A normal map to m`vipg>`` (or m`vip2g>``).

	

================================================================================
REQUIREMENTS							*atp-requirements*

This plugin requires Vim version 7.3.  Several tools uses syntax, so even if
you do not like colours on the screen you should set "syntax on". For example,
the recognition of math mode used by |atp-completion|, and |atp-:TexAlign|
command (but also some other things, and some maps!).

								*atp-requirements-python*
ATP uses python 2.7 (also works with python 3). You need psutil library which
you can get from here:
    http://code.google.com/p/psutil/
Other libraries are standard ones so they should be available. If you have
a problem you can try to set g:atp_debugPythonCompiler=1 and then look at the
file PythonCompiler.log under |g:atp_TempDir| it will contain python errors.

It is nice to have 'texdoc' program. This plugin maps <F1> to a function which
calls it. This allows to speed up searches for documentation. Also the option
'keywordprg' has the value "texdoc -m", thus pressing 'K' (see |K|) over a tex
package should open you the package documentation. The same applies to this
help file.

Another good programs are: texloganalyzer (which is now not used by ATP) and pdffonts
There is a map to use pdffonts, see: |pdffonts|.

The command |atp-:WordCount| is using detex program. It is included in TexLive
tex distrubution.

================================================================================
NOTES ON VIEWERS                          			*atp-Viewers*

See the section |atp-Viewers_Options| how to set options for viewer programs.

Xpdf								*atp-Viewers-Xpdf*
	It is supported. It is configured in the way that when your tex file
	have errors, Xpdf viewer will not reload your file, which I found
	useful. Xpdf supports forward searching (vim->Xpdf) with command:
	|atp-:SyncTex| >
		:SyncTex
		map t
		map <S-LeftMouse>
<	Read also |atp-:SyncTex_Xpdf-hack| and see |atp-:SetXpdf| command
	description.  You can set your own options of Xpdf using
	|b:atp_xpdfOptions| (or g:atp_xpdfOptions), for example:
>
	    let b:atp_xpdfOptions=['-bg', 'NavajoWhite4', '-fg', 'black', '-mattecolor', 'burylwood']
<
	will make Xpdf view different. This is helpful when you edit to
	files, and do not want to mix them. Another nice example:
>
	    let b:atp_xpdfOptions="-bg Grey30 -mattecolor SlateBlue2 -papercolor White"
<
Evince
	Works fine.
								*atp-Viewers-Okular*
Okular
	Works fine. It supports both forward (Vim->Okular) and inverse
	(Okular->Vim) searches. Okular supports forward searching (vim->Okular)
	with command: |atp-:SyncTex| >
		:SyncTex
		map t
		map <S-LeftMouse>
<	Here is how to CONFIGURE REVERSE SEARCHING (Okular->Vim): 
	open Okular and go to >
		settings>Configure Okular>Editor
<	and set >
		Editor		Custom Text Editor
		Command		python $HOME/.vim/ftplugin/ATP_files/atp_RevSearch.py '%f' '%l'
<	NOTE: You must substitute $HOME directory to its value!!! It will not
	work other way. You can also copy the script somewhere inside your
	$PATH but then when this script will change you have to keep in mind
	to copy it again. 

	If you set the command as above (with python before the path to
	atp_RevSearch.py) you do not need to make atp_RevSearch.py executable.
	Note, that otherwise whenever you update ATP you will have to make the
	script executable!

	If it is not working for you, please report it, you can also
	use: >
	    gvim --remote-wait +%l "+normal %c|" %f
<
								*atp-:SyncTex_with_Okular*
	NOTE: :SyncTex command uses "--unique" switch for okular. However,
	when you do not set |b:atp_okularOptions| to ["--unique"] as well, then
	using :SyncTex will open new instance of Okular regardless if it was
	openned or not. You can use "--unique" as an Okular option (in
	g:atp_okularOptins or b:atp_okularOptions), but the if you open many
	files tex, all will use only one instance of Okular. This is
	a limitation of using Okular. Xpdf has a server option which allows
	for vim->Xpdf communication to the right Xpdf instance.  

	Then you can use <Shift>+<Left_Mouse> in Okular to synchronize the Vim
	(gVim) with pdf. 

								*atplib#FindAndOpen()*	
	The function atplib#FindAndOpen() asks each running gvim server if is
	is "hosting" source of the file %f. Then it uses this server to set
	the line (but it doesn't check if the cursor is in the right window!).
	Note: if you like command line Vim (which has its own beauty
	- actually I'm just typing in it :) you need to set up Vim server
	  option on startup: >
 		vim --servername VIM <file>
<	{LIMITATIONS}:
	The project files which are split into many input files are not yet
	supported.
	

Kpdf
	Works fine (moves page a little bit when updates a file).

EpdfView
	This viewer does not support automatic reloads when the file changes
	(but it seems that the work is in progress). You have to issue CTRL-R
	yourself when the file is changed.

AcroRead
	As with epdfview (with the difference that it supports automatic
	updates, but it do not works somehow). There is a way to configure
	forward searching (Vim->AcroRead)! but it is not supported yet, if you
	really want it, write to me.

Xdvi								*atp-Viewers-Xdvi*
	Works fine. The file will be updated after a click (or use the xdvi
	options '-watchfile 1' see man xdvi for explanations). You can set
	forward/reverse searching by the command |SetXdvi| then use
	|atp-:SyncTex| for forward searching (Vim->Xdvi). To get reverse
	searching Xdvi must be opened by ATP (:ViewOutput, or any other
	command)

	If you want to use Vim you have to run it with the command: >
 		vim --servername xdvi <file>
<	You can pick any server name.
	
	ATP supports forward (Vim->Xdvi) and inverse (Xdvi->Vim) searching for
	Xdvi. The forward search is set by ATP (see |atp:SyncTex|), the
	inverse search is set by: >
	    let b:atp_TexCompiler	= "latex"
	    let b:atp_TexOptions	= ["-src-specials"]
	    let b:atp_Viewer		= "xdvi" 
	    let b:atp_xdviOptions	= ["-editor", "'gvim --remote-wait +%l %f'"]
<	They are not set by default, however there is simple command to set
	them at once |atp-:SetXdvi|.	
	This are excellent sources of information on this:
	    http://xdvi.sourceforge.net/inverse-search.html
	    http://Vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_can_interact_with_xdvi

Zathura							
	Perfectly works (but there is no reverse/inverse searching).

Mupdf
	It is the fastest pdf viewer program ever made, why? because it
	renders only one page :). But it can be nicly set with ATP: via
	autocommands and :SyncTex you can load a page where the cursor is
	located (for example with autocmd event |CursorHold|). This might be
	nice on a big enough monitor on which you can see both vim and mupdf
	on one screen.

================================================================================
TIPS                               				*atp-tips*

If you have any nice tip on editing (La)TeX with Vim or ATP :) you can share it
here (my email you'll find on top of the help file), or put them on the script
web page. 


nmap gS :%s/<c-r>=expand("<cword>")<cr>/
				Pull word under the cursor to substitute
				command. 

:g/^[^%]*\\usepackge/#		List loaded packages with line numbers

y/\\begin{document}/		When standing on 1st line - copy the preamble
				(possibly to a register)
:g/^\s*%/d			Delete comment lines 				

:g/\(^\s*\n\)\{2,}/d		Compress empty lines 
					/ when there are more than two empty
					lines it leaves just one /  

vipgq				Format inner paragraph. Or even better:
m`vipgq``			This is so nice that I added a map: >
				    nmap gq	m`vipgq``		
<
m`vip>``			
m`vip<``			Indent inner paragraph, they are mapped to: >
				    nmap g>	m`vip>``
				    nmap g<	m`vip<``
<				There are also defined maps: 2g>, 3g> , 4g>
				up to 6g>.

:TeXdoc ams<Ctrl-d>		Show tex documentation which matches ams (the
				completion for TeXdoc command finds matches in
				alias files of texdoc :!texdoc -f).
\ref{^thm:<Tab>			will list all cross references to theorems (if
				you use the prefix thm: for theorems.

				If you want to change the name of a command,
				you can try:
augroup DelCommands
    au VimEnter *tex delcommand SetXdvi
    au VimEnter *tex delcommand SetXpdf
augroup END
command! -buffer	Xdvi	:call SetXdvi()
command! -buffer	Xpdf	:call SetXpdf()

				However, not all functions are defined without
				<SID> (you can always try to reach me).

:'<,'>WrapSelection @q		Wrap a visual area with wrapper from the
				register q and with the default '}' end
				wrapper.
:'<,'>WrapSelection @q,@w	As above but with the end wrapper from
				register w. 

:map ]=		]sz=		Goto the first spelling error and list 
:map [=		[sz=		suggestions. Another version is to use
				]S and [S instead of ]s and [s.
				

================================================================================
COLOUR HIGHLIGHTING AND SYNTAX GROUPS				*atp-highlight*

When the cursor is positioned on \begin{envname} or \end{envname} both
corresponding \begin:\end get highlighted with syntax group MatchParen. 
To disable it type this in ex mode or put it in your atprc file: >
	augroup LatexBox_HighlightPairs 
	     au!
	augroup END
<

There is a colour scheme included: coots-beauty-256. You need 256 colours to use
it (in the terminal). 

These are the highlights groups defined for various files and the default
links:

1) ToC file >
	highlight atp_FileName		Title
	highlight atp_LineNr		LineNr
	highlight atp_Number		Number
	highlight atp_Chapter		Label
	highlight atp_Section		Label
	highlight atp_SubSection	Label
	highlight atp_Abstract		Label
<		*this group highlights abstract and all the unnumbered chapters
		 and the bibliography.

    The chapter group highlights or chapters, or sections, or parts, depending
    what is your top level section in your latex document. This applies,
    accordingly, to other groups.

2) Labels file >
	highlight atp_label_FileName	Title
	highlight atp_label_LineNr	LineNr
	highlight atp_label_Name 	Label
	highlight atp_label_Counter 	Keyword
<
3) BibSearch file
    this is very much the same as the standard syntax for bib files. Groups
    are named bibsearch<NAME> instead of bib<NAME>. There is one more group
    added:
>
	highlight bibsearchInfo
<
    which highlights the line number of the bib entry in the bib file.  All
    bibsearch groups are by default linked to the bib groups.

    Yet, there is no default highlighting, try coots-beauty-256 colour scheme.
    If you like it, I'm glad, if you have a nice (non standard) colour scheme,
    I'm happy to get it, if you like to share it.

4) Status line:
    The notification message that your compiler is running can be highlighted.
    For this set the variables: >
    	g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_gui
    	g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_guifg
    	g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_guibg
<   Their values will be passed to gui guifg and guibg values of the highlight
    command. The g:colors_name variable is set by colour scheme. Usually it is
    just the colour scheme name but there might be a difference, for example:
    the provided colour scheme file name is 'coots-beauty-256' but the variable
    is set to 'coots_beauty_256'. Example: >
    	let g:atp_notification_coots_beauty_256_gui="DeepPink4"
<   will set the foreground colour of 'pdfLaTeX' message to DeepPink4.

							*atp-highlight-notification*
    The status message 'LaTeX' ( if you use latex or 'pdfLaTeX' when you use
    pdflatex, and so on) can be highlighted. There are several variables to
    set this: >

<   where g:colors_name is the name of the colour scheme, for example the
    supplied colour scheme with atp 'runtimepath/colors/coots-beauty-256' has
    name 'coots_beauty_256' so the first variable should be >
		g:atp_highlight_coots_beauty_256_gui
<   value of these variables are used to set highlight for the group UserN
    where N is the value of g:atp_statusNotifHi. Its value should be
    0,1,...,9. Where 0 means no highlight for status notification (which is
    the default). If it is set to positive value then the default values of
    these variables should give the same colour as the status line has.

    								*g:atp_StatusLine*
    The variable g:atp_StatusLine is stores the value of Vim option
    'statusline'; actually 'statusline' option is set by: >
		set statusline=%!g:atp_StatusLine
